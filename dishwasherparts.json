This had no impact on the functionality, but did add a small amount of noise during the wash cycle. My belief is this is the water hitting the steel vs. hitting the plastic. Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "Can you send me instruction and pictures to install the upper rack wheels and brackets to the rack. They are not like the ones that are on it now    thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi David, \n\nThank you for your question. First you will have to remove your upper dish rack and the old adjust kit. Now, when installing the new kit, count 4 rungs from the back of the basket toward the front. Take your  new metal adjuster and thread the shaft through the fourth rung. You may have to tilt it to get it through. When you straighten the part the wheels portion should be on the outside of the rack and the shaft will  be on the inside of the rack. Take your positioner clips and use them to secure the adjuster to the rack. You will see two front tabs and two back tabs. The back tabs will also need to be tilted into place so that they are on the inside of the rack. The flat part of the positioner clips should be on the outside of the rack. Then you will push the clips down on to the adjuster to clip them into place. Now you will have to install the adjuster body on to the adjuster. Pull your adjuster all the way down. Tilt the adjusted toward the inside of the rack, you will notice that the adjuster body has a channel that will fit the adjuster. Slide those two pieces into place together. You will have 4 notches on your adjuster body that fit perfectly with your rack. Pull on your metal adjuster to lock it into place. Grab your actuator. You want to make sure that the thumb pad of your actuator is facing toward the inside of the rack and is closer to the front of the rack. Pull the adjuster arm up as far as you can, so that the body is a little bit above the top of the rack. The set the actuator inside of the two slots at the top of the body. You may have to tilt the body toward the inside of the rack to fit the actuator into place. Once you have that part in place, push the whole assembly down and press it back up against the side of the rack into place again. Now you will take the adjuster cover and install it on to the body from the outside of the rack. There is a little tab at the top of the cover, you will have to push that into place in the slot at the top of the adjuster body. That just snaps down into place. Then you install your two T15 Torx screws into the cover to hold it into place. This installation is the same for both sides. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "The right hand side of the upper rack isn’t connected to the metal track anymore and therefore can’t hold any weight on the right side. Is there a better part to fix this.",

The adjuster kit would come with all parts for the right and left side of the upper rack and would be the only parts that would fix the issue you're having. I hope this helps!"

Check the dishwasher after 30 minutes to make sure the diagnostic cycle is complete, in which case the light should no longer be blinking. We hope this helps."

You might want to check the wheels on the brackets on either side of the rack to be sure there is no obstructions or the wheels are coming out of the track. You may have a bent track or wheel and bracket assembly. The rack should pull out almost the whole way. You can also adjust the rack by pressing the adjuster thumb button on either side of the rack. I hope this helps!"

BTW, your customer service is excellent.Reviewed YouTube videos.Patience is required, take your time, take photos of the wires and also make a written wiring chart. This was the flaw in my planning. Reference the schematics f rom PartsSelect to number the controls. Do NOT use masking tape to identify the wires as they will have all stuck together by the time you go to reinstall them. Most difficult process was removing and identifying the numerous wires to the back panel. They have push connectors, but some were very difficult to remove. The people doing the \"how to\" videos no doubt had them partially released and that made it look easy. Examine the connectors before removing to identify how they are captured by the connector. A paper clip \"tool\" I made enabled me to release some of the capture lugs, but some were so tight, I had to use small needle-nose pliers to open up the lug to release the wire on the connector. When reinstalling, re-tighten those connectors.Replacing the parts was much easier than the wiring disconnect/reconnect process. I'm happy to report that replacing the rear bearing and the front 2 green and 2 white shim/bearings immediately and completely solved my problem. For about $150, I restored my dryer to \"like-new\" functionality and got a lot of satisfaction from doing it. The project took about 4 hours, which could have been reduced to 2 hours had I know about the clip release and wiring identification process. Also, make sure you thoroughly vacuum out your unit while it is disassembled. Good luck!!! Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

The video showed exactly how to dismantle the old part and then install the new part. It was also helpful to compare the part I was working with to the same part on the other side of the rack so that I knew for sure that I had it positioned correctly.The part and shipping cost about $70.

Release the track stops from the upper dishrack rails and pull the upper rack from the dishwasher and place it upside down on a work surface.  Raise the wheels to the maximum height.  Release the top of the long rear clip from the dishrack tine and push the clip down to the release point and remove it.  Press the tab down on the front clip move the clip up to pull it off. Release the locking tabs  on the clip in the middle of the height adjuster and remove the clip. Using a slot screw driver pry the housing cover down and out to release the upper tabs on each side.  Pry the bottom of the housing cover out of the 2 lower locking tabs.  Pull the housing cover off the rack.  Remove the adjuster housing and wheel assembly and repeat the procedure on the other side.  Slide the vertical portion on the new wheel assembly between the fourth set of vertical tines from the back of the dishrack and rotate the wheel assembly so that it lays flat against the side.  Insert a positioner clip above the rear wheel and snap the tab into the slot.  Install a positioner clip on the front wheel.  Position the adjuster body over the vertical portion of the wheel assembly and push in into the slots. Locking tabs at the bottom of the adjuster body engage the the wheel assembly once it is fully inserted the tabs.  Insert the actuator lever into the adjuster body with the thumb pad facing the front of the rack.  Two half circle cut outs on the adjuster body hold the actuator in place.  Push the adjuster body down and install the adjuster cover.  Install the adjuster cover mounting screws.  Repeat this process on the other side of the rack.  Push the upper dishrack onto its tracks.  Close the track stops on the rails and the repair is done. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Use a small flat head screwdriver to depress the retaining tabs securing the rack adjustors to the tracks. Fully remove the upper rack. Using the flat blade screwdriver, release the tabs to detach the adjuster housing cover and remove the housing. Next detach the front and rear adjuster support straps from the tines and remove them from the rack adjuster. Note the orientation of the rack adjuster, then pry off the stop clip to detach the old adjuster. Install the new adjuster by aligning it on the rack and snap the stop clip into place to secure. Next replace the front and rear support straps. Position the adjuster housing by aligning the locking lever in the adjuster slot then snap the cover on to secure. Then put the upper rack back into place.  Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Good Day Betsy. Thank you for your question in regards to the Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm (PartSelect Number PS12585623). Based on our research, here are the steps to replace the part: 1) Ensure your unit is unplugged or the circuit breakers are off before beginning any repair. 2) Turn off the dishwashers water supply underneath the sink. 3) Open up the dishwasher door. 4) Pull the lower rack out and set it aside. 5) Reach in to remove the lower wash arm (On each side on the bottom of the Spray Arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screw driver to release it from the unit). 6) Once locking tabs have been released, you can pull it off the dishwasher. 7) Put the new lower wash arm in (simply set it down onto its support and push it down to lock it in place). 8) Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. 9) Put the lower dish rack back in. 10) Close the dishwasher door and you are done. We hope this helps! Best Regards."

To locate the filter look into the upper left corner of the refrigerator.  When you have located the filter, place a towel on the shelf just under where the filter is in case any water spills out.  Open the door and swing the filter to the right until it stops.  The filter will not release until it is in this position and simply pull the old cartridge out without twisting it.  Align the top of the new filter in the holder with the word front facing outward.  Firmly push the filter in until it engages to insure it is properly seated.  Again being careful not to twist the filter.  Swing filter back into place and close the filter door.  If your filter does not swing into place, make sure that it has been aligned and engaged properly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Firmly push the filter in until it engages to insure it is properly seated. Again being careful not to twist the filter. Swing filter back into place and close the filter door. If your filter does not swing into place, make sure that it has been aligned and engaged properly. I hope this helps. Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Hi...i followed the steps to change the filter, reset it and now is not dispensing water...is this something i'm doing wrong?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Azucena, Thank you for your inquiry. I would try taking the filter out and make sure the lines are clean. I have included the installation steps as well. If your fridge still is not dispensing water I would check your water inlet valve and the line that runs from it to the filter. Hope this helps! \n\nBefore removing the old filter, place a cloth beneath the filter to catch the few drops of water that may fall when the filter is removed. Grasp the filter and turn it to the left until it stops, while gently pulling downward from the filter head. Keep the filter level to minimize water spillage. (If the filter doesn't come loose easily, air may be trapped inside. To relieve any pressure, push in on the water dispenser; the filter should drop right out.) Remove and discard the plastic cap from the new filter. Fill the top of the replacement filter with water from the tap. Place the filter inside the cartridge holder by aligning the arrow on your filter with the cartridge holder. Push the filter gently upward to engage the top of the cartridge in the filter head. Slowly turn the filter to the right until the filter cartridge stops turning. As you turn the cartridge, it will automatically rise into position. After the filter has been replaced, trapped air must be purged out of the system. Select Water on the dispenser selector and press the pad until water begins to flow. The first few ounces of water may sputter due to air in the replacement filter. This is normal. Continue to dispense approximately 1-2 gallons of water to make sure all air is purged from the system."

Grey Model: Pull the bottom of the old cartridge allowing it to swing outward. Pull to free the cartridge from the holder without twisting it. To install the new filter, center it with the holder, making sure the word \"FRONT\" is facing forward and centered. Swing the filter inwards until it is positioned. Black Model: Pull on the bottom of the old cartridge to unlock it from the clips. Swing it outward until you hear a clicking sound. Now twist the cartridge one-quarter of a turn counter-clockwise. Pull it out to remove. To install the new filter, match the filter cartridge with the holder, making sure the word \"FRONT\" is facing the top of the appliance. Push the filter toward the back of the appliance until it is secured. Twist it clockwise one-quarter of a turn so the word \"FRONT\" is facing outward. Swing filter inward until it is secured.

If there is no ice obstructing the tube and cup, test the water inlet valve to be sure both ports on the valve are working. Here is a link on how to test the water valve. https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator+test-water-valve+repair.htm. You can also try to run the following test on the icemaker itself.Turn icemaker Off for 15 seconds and turn back on,Push in on paddle 3 times and only 3 times within 15 seconds of powering the icemaker back on.Within 3 minutes, the icemaker should enter the harvest mode.The heater will turn on for a about of 20 seconds, and the comb inside the icemaker will make one full revolution and return to the \"Home\" position.At the end of 3 minutes, the icemaker mold should fill with water.The green light under the ON/OFF switch should be on and steady.If this does not fix the issue you may need to replace the icemaker.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi David, \n\nThank you for your question. First you will have to remove your upper dish rack and the old adjust kit. Now, when installing the new kit, count 4 rungs from the back of the basket toward the front. Take your  new metal adjuster and thread the shaft through the fourth rung. You may have to tilt it to get it through. When you straighten the part the wheels portion should be on the outside of the rack and the shaft will  be on the inside of the rack. Take your positioner clips and use them to secure the adjuster to the rack. You will see two front tabs and two back tabs. The back tabs will also need to be tilted into place so that they are on the inside of the rack. The flat part of the positioner clips should be on the outside of the rack. Then you will push the clips down on to the adjuster to clip them into place. Now you will have to install the adjuster body on to the adjuster. Pull your adjuster all the way down. Tilt the adjusted toward the inside of the rack, you will notice that the adjuster body has a channel that will fit the adjuster. Slide those two pieces into place together. You will have 4 notches on your adjuster body that fit perfectly with your rack. Pull on your metal adjuster to lock it into place. Grab your actuator. You want to make sure that the thumb pad of your actuator is facing toward the inside of the rack and is closer to the front of the rack. Pull the adjuster arm up as far as you can, so that the body is a little bit above the top of the rack. The set the actuator inside of the two slots at the top of the body. You may have to tilt the body toward the inside of the rack to fit the actuator into place. Once you have that part in place, push the whole assembly down and press it back up against the side of the rack into place again. Now you will take the adjuster cover and install it on to the body from the outside of the rack. There is a little tab at the top of the cover, you will have to push that into place in the slot at the top of the adjuster body. That just snaps down into place. Then you install your two T15 Torx screws into the cover to hold it into place. This installation is the same for both sides. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The video showed exactly how to dismantle the old part and then install the new part. It was also helpful to compare the part I was working with to the same part on the other side of the rack so that I knew for sure that I had it positioned correctly.The part and shipping cost about $70.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Val,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Before beginning any repair please unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Release the track stops from the upper dishrack rails and pull the upper rack from the dishwasher and place it upside down on a work surface.  Raise the wheels to the maximum height.  Release the top of the long rear clip from the dishrack tine and push the clip down to the release point and remove it.  Press the tab down on the front clip move the clip up to pull it off. Release the locking tabs  on the clip in the middle of the height adjuster and remove the clip. Using a slot screw driver pry the housing cover down and out to release the upper tabs on each side.  Pry the bottom of the housing cover out of the 2 lower locking tabs.  Pull the housing cover off the rack.  Remove the adjuster housing and wheel assembly and repeat the procedure on the other side.  Slide the vertical portion on the new wheel assembly between the fourth set of vertical tines from the back of the dishrack and rotate the wheel assembly so that it lays flat against the side.  Insert a positioner clip above the rear wheel and snap the tab into the slot.  Install a positioner clip on the front wheel.  Position the adjuster body over the vertical portion of the wheel assembly and push in into the slots. Locking tabs at the bottom of the adjuster body engage the the wheel assembly once it is fully inserted the tabs.  Insert the actuator lever into the adjuster body with the thumb pad facing the front of the rack.  Two half circle cut outs on the adjuster body hold the actuator in place.  Push the adjuster body down and install the adjuster cover.  Install the adjuster cover mounting screws.  Repeat this process on the other side of the rack.  Push the upper dishrack onto its tracks.  Close the track stops on the rails and the repair is done. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Mark, Thank you for your inquiry. At this time, we do not have a video for this exact part number but I have found instructions for you. Use a small flat head screwdriver to depress the retaining tabs securing the rack adjustors to the tracks. Fully remove the upper rack. Using the flat blade screwdriver, release the tabs to detach the adjuster housing cover and remove the housing. Next detach the front and rear adjuster support straps from the tines and remove them from the rack adjuster. Note the orientation of the rack adjuster, then pry off the stop clip to detach the old adjuster. Install the new adjuster by aligning it on the rack and snap the stop clip into place to secure. Next replace the front and rear support straps. Position the adjuster housing by aligning the locking lever in the adjuster slot then snap the cover on to secure. Then put the upper rack back into place.  Hope this helps!"

You would locate your model number on the left edge of the dishwasher's door, on the upper left hand corner of the unit's frame, on the top of the door jamb-to the left, right, or in the center, on the door itself, to the left, right or in the center, or on the underside of the control panel.

You might want to check the wheels on the brackets on either side of the rack to be sure there is no obstructions or the wheels are coming out of the track. You may have a bent track or wheel and bracket assembly. The rack should pull out almost the whole way. You can also adjust the rack by pressing the adjuster thumb button on either side of the rack. I hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Looking for the dishrack stop for my upper dishrack on my dishwasher. I think my unit has two of these- one on the left and one on the right. Does this purchase only come with one stop and is it for the left or the right or both?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Mike, this order will come with 1 dishrack stop, and can be used for the left or the right side. If both dishrack stops need replacing, you will have to purchase 2 of these. Best of luck with this repair."

        "customerQuestion": "Re:  Wpw10195622 “rack stop clip”.  Your answer to multiple questions (paul, et al) is wrong. This part goes in the back end of the “slide rail”/“drawer track” (wpw10195623) to keep the track from coming off, and to remove or replace when removing and replacing the rail.  It is more robust than the front rack stop, which is part of the “drawer track” assembly and apparently not available separately.  This front stop consists of a robust plastic base, that is molded (melted) permanently onto the front end of the metal rail (“track”), and a flimsier plastic from stop that snaps on and swivels 90 degrees to allow you to remove the drawer for cleaning.  This front swiveling drawer stop is the one that breaks so that the rack comes off the rail if you pull it out too far.  The only way to get this part is to replace the “drawer track” (above), or canabolize another machine, since it is part of that assembly.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Tim, \n\nThank you for your information, that is very helpful. One thing to note is that not all models are actually formatted the same. Though many models use the same sort of parts, they are not all used the same way. Some models use this clip as the front piece, in your particular case it is used as the back piece and the front piece only comes with the rack track. If you ever have any questions about parts just let us know, we can generally determine what part goes where by using your diagrams. I hope that helps. Have a great day."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Penny and thanks for writing.\nPS11750071 This rack stop clip works for either the right or left side of your upper dish rack.

Do i need to replace the whole rail ?  Is there instructions ?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Steve,\n\nThank you for your question. We had a similar question asked by another customer, here is the answer: start by pulling out the rack. Then, using a small flat blade screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. From there the stops can be pulled off the track. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello John,\n\nThanks for your question. On the adjuster are two round ends that are clipped into the positioners which help it to stay in place which should be removed. Remove any baskets that are in the way and lower any tines near the positioner. Install the new positioner by aligning it on the rack. Lift the tines\nto make sure they lock properly, and replace any baskets you may have taken out.\n\nI hope this helps."

Please could you tell me what the assembly kit part number is?  I understand from reading that most of the parts for the kit had been updated and that is why you need to purchase the kit rather than just the one piece that connects to the wheel.  Is that correct?  Thank you.  I appreciate your time and help.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello and thank you for writing.\nPart Number: PS10064063. The clip that holds the wheel is only sold as part of the adjuster. The adjuster is only sold as a kit now due to an update to the parts. This kit includes the parts to replace the left and right-side rack adjusters and has been upgraded to more durable metal design.

Although only the left side track failed, the right side would have soon enough.This repair was fairly simple. First, toggle the circuit breaker off and turn off the water supply under the sink. Remove gray plastic covers to expose and remove Phillips head screws on each side of inner door frame then remove plastic kick plate before sliding the dishwasher out roughly 20”. The insulation needs to be folded back (tab release back bottom corner) to expose the four rack fasteners on each side. A small socket bit (I used a slow speed hand drill) makes quick work of removing old tracks but make sure one hand is inside on the track to catch what’s left of it. Replace both tracks (the second will fail) arrow pointing up using the fasteners you removed. Reset the insulation and make sure water, drain and electrical connectors are all in good order before sliding dishwasher back and fastening side frame screws to adjoining cabinets (tip: use painter’s tape or similar to keep screw head connected to screwdriver). Replace plastic caps and the kick plate. I had to replace the upper rack adjuster before reinstalling the upper rack on the new tracks. Check the bottom filter and reservoir for any plastic bits or ball bearings and remove them before turning power and water back on. Enjoy not having to hand wash dishes again. For me, about 40 minutes. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Doug and thanks for writing.\nWe do not have a video but here are step by step instructions.\nUse a 1/4\" nut driver to remove the bottom front (kick) plate from the appliance. There are two screws, one at each end. There should also be two screws fastening the dishwasher to the countertop. You'll need to open the dishwasher door to see these and remove them. At the bottom of the dishwasher again, you might need to screw the front (2) leveling feet in to lower the dishwasher and provide clearance. Once done, just (gently, slowly) pull the appliance out of the cabinet. Check to make sure your power wiring, drain hose, and water supply hose are all long enough to do this. If necessary, disconnect any of these that are too short. if your power wiring is short, as mine was, you'll need to disconnect the circuit breaker, then remove the junction box at the lower front right side of the dishwasher, then disconnect the power and ground wires.\nOnce out of the cabinet, use a 5/16\" nut driver to remove the four screws holding each rack slide in place and remove the track. The rubber mounts will come out with the track (new tracks include new rubber mounts). Clean any residue from the track mounting area inside the tub before installing the new track. This whole replacement process should take a total of 3-4 minutes per side.\nTo finish up, just reverse the process. When sliding the dishwasher back into place, make sure the fiberglass insulation stays in place completely around the outside of the tub. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime."

        "repairInstruction": "Make sure you have everything you need before you start. The upper rack adjuster broke when the left track failed and needed to be replaced. Although only the left side track failed, the right side would have soon enough.This repair was fairly simple. First, toggle the circuit breaker off and turn off the water supply under the sink. Remove gray plastic covers to expose and remove Phillips head screws on each side of inner door frame then remove plastic kick plate before sliding the dishwasher out roughly 20”. The insulation needs to be folded back (tab release back bottom corner) to expose the four rack fasteners on each side. A small socket bit (I used a slow speed hand drill) makes quick work of removing old tracks but make sure one hand is inside on the track to catch what’s left of it. Replace both tracks (the second will fail) arrow pointing up using the fasteners you removed. Reset the insulation and make sure water, drain and electrical connectors are all in good order before sliding dishwasher back and fastening side frame screws to adjoining cabinets (tip: use painter’s tape or similar to keep screw head connected to screwdriver). Replace plastic caps and the kick plate. I had to replace the upper rack adjuster before reinstalling the upper rack on the new tracks. Check the bottom filter and reservoir for any plastic bits or ball bearings and remove them before turning power and water back on. Enjoy not having to hand wash dishes again. For me, about 40 minutes. Read less"

Can you help me?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Helena, based on your situation we recommend pressing the gasket with controlled pressure into the channel that is on the inner door liner. It should be a snug fit, and if it is too loose it needs to be pushed in further. I hope this helps."

Then check that the door aligns with the tub opening, and that the splash guard does not have any damage. If everything is in good condition, check the float for sticking, and the spray arm for splitting. One of these should solve your problem. However, if you are still having leakage, please let us know and we will help you solve it."

        "customerQuestion": "I recently replaced the door latch but lately I am getting water dripping onto the floor in front of the unit from the top of the door from a lot of condensation along the entire top of the door during the final drying mode. When I push the top of the door in the heat that escapes is reduced and just comes out of the vent on the left top of the door which is what it is supposed to do. Since there is no actual water escaping from the door seal would replacing the door seal solve this problem?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Frank, Thank you for the question, I suggest checking the gasket to make sure it has no defects or damage keeping the door from sealing all the way unless pressure is applied. You can also check the door strike, the part the latch would connect with. Make sure it isn't lose or is damaged and preventing the latch from fully keeping the door closed.You can also check to make sure the hinges are not warped or bent. The door should be sitting level when it is closed. Hope this helps!"

That will be a major project when the dishwasher dies.To remove the door, I removed the two 1/4 \" screws on the right and left bottom of the door. I used a box wrench since that was the only way to reach t hem. One had corroded due to a leak. it took some coaxing but finally came loose. The hint about opening the door 27 degrees and propping it open with two Allan wrenches through the hinge holes was very helpful. Then I lifted the door a little and gently pushed toward the counter releasing the door form the hinges. I took the door off to find a leak and found the right corner edge of the inside tub had cracked. Not sure how this happened. I cleaned and sanded the crack area and used J-B Weld to epoxy the crack. Replacing the gasket was easy. Slide out the old, slide in the new. Everything went back together smoothly. If I hadn't needed to repair the tub, the hint about opening the door all the way and sliding it out part way might have worked to change the gasket. Note. Unlike a stove door the dishwasher door is not that heavy. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Nathalie,\nThank you for your question.  Here are some installation instructions from our website that you may reference for more information, \"Remove the lower dish tray and set it aside. Remove the two Phillips screws on each side of inner liner, and then close door. You should then be able to slip off the external facing and set it aside. Pull the lower gasket toward the tub until it is fully removed. Reinsert the new gasket into the same tight slot, making sure that the notch inserts into the slot and that the flexible gasket runs the full length of the tub. The gasket should bow out slightly toward the tub. Also, make sure that the side seals do not interfere with the bottom seal fully mating with the floor of the tub. Close the door and check to make sure the lower gasket reveal is the same across the length of the inner liner. Reinstall the dish tray, then reinstall the external facing, using the same four Phillips screws to secure it. Test the sealing by running a short cycle on the dishwasher.\" We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

Problem is when the washer arm comes around, water pushes out of all of the holes in the gasket. \n\nI read where this could mean the washer arm is shooting water straight at the door, but have no way to check that. Have you heard of this?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Luke, thank you for your inquiry. First, check for obstructions inside the spray arm. There are small holes that the water pushes out of. Check there is not debris blocking the flow of water. If possible, visually inspect the washer arm while the dishwasher is running to see if it is spraying water evenly or if it is aimed at the door. Also check the water pressure, if water pressure is high it can also cause this issue. If all checks are fine, we would recommend replacing the pump and motor assembly, part number PS3497737. We hope this sorts out your problem!"

See the steps required for replacement below:The * ind icates the part number in the diagram I am referencing1. Remove the Toe Kick Assembly (*759)2. Remove screws holding dishwasher to counter and pull the dishwasher out3. With door shut, disengage the springs on both sides from the arm hinge assemblies *800 (I did this by taking the rope off the pulley hinge *734)4. Disconnect the wire going from the dishwasher body to the door (there are two or three supports for the wire that need to be removed for it to come free)5. Open the door about 15 degrees and pull the door upward (only one angle will work for removing the door)6. Place the door on its front on the ground7. Remove the two screws (*745) that hold one of the arm hinge assemblies to the door and pull the hinge away from the door (you don't need to pull it all of the way out)8.

Last you need a small star driver to remove the door screws. Note 4 of the door screws, the 4 on top of the door are much longer than the side screws. With all this said, this seal was not my problem. I then replaced the large black rubber seal around the tub. Be sure if you do this you fold the seal in half and start in the middle of the top of the opening so you have the exact amount of seal left over on both sides. Also when you remove the old seal, clean the area it was removed from with a damp cloth. Turns out, That was not my problem either. So now I will move to the next step to see where the water is coming from but maybe this information will help someone with a simple door leak. Read less"

It is the only part along the bottom of the DW door so it is indeed a seal, and the DW was leaking after I replaced the seal around the tub and the door. First take off the inner panel of the door by removing the Torx screws on the edge and the hinges. Pay at tention to which hole each screw came out because they are different lengths. Gently separate the inner panel being careful with the wires going to the detergent dispenser. The seal is held on by 5 small hex head screws on the bottom of the door panel.

Not sure how this plastic piece even seals the bottom door.\n\nShould there be some sort of rubber on the bottom seal? Is there something I am missing.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Herbert, Thank you for your inquiry. We do not show that there is any rubber on the bottom door seal, which is designed to seal the gap between the opening to the dishwasher tub and the outer edge of the door. You mentioned you replaced the seal around the tub PS11731683 so we would also recommend checking the door seal part# PS12348515. If that does not fix the issue, you may want to look at the filter, drain pump, circulation pump or hoses to see if there is any visible damage. Good luck with your repair."

If the water level is normal, you should remove the filters and clean them. If the filters are in bad condition you may need to replace them. Best of luck with this repair."

If the dishwasher is still not cleaning once you figure out what part is missing, There are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.

Once that is removed. turn the rack upside down and pull the old spray arm toward the back of the rack to unclip it from the rack. Once that is off you can reverse these steps to install the new one.  Here is a video for a similar part, that might help! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TV0f1yMZhU"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jim,\n\nThank you for contacting. Unfortunately we cannot view your video link. It will not open for us. However it sounds like it may just be that you have something clogged inside of your spray arm and that part will need to be replaced. There is a flap on your manifold just before the spray arm, if you believe that flap is what is causing the water not to get to your spray arm, then you would have to replace your manifold to fix that as the little gasket that will close off the adjustable heights on your manifold is only sold with the entire manifold. So there are really only two parts that it could be for you, your spray arm itself or your manifold. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If the lower spray arm is clogged, try soaking it in a solution of warm water and vinegar and use a fine pin to remove any blockages from the spray holes.  If this does not help, you will need to replace the lower spray arm.  If you need to place an order for the lower spray arm, you may order it either online or by calling our customer service line and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Pam, Thank you for your inquiry. This issue can be caused by one of the spray arms hitting something as the dishwasher is washing. Check the middle and lower spray arms for any obstructions or loose connections. We also recommend checking the door springs, the door balance kit, and the pump and motor assembly. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

        "customerQuestion": "Dishwasher is leaking from the bottom of the door.  Have replaced the lower door seal and the inlet control valve. Set the front to back level so that it is slightly inclined to the rear. Reduced the amount of the water leaking but did not eliminate it. Next will replace the lower wash arm. If the leak still persists do you have any ideas or is it time to call a repair technician? Thanks.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi David, thank you for the question. If you find the dishwasher leaking from the bottom of the door, a clogged drain is usually the reason. Located at the base of the dishwasher, food particles, soap residue, and other debris can cause clogs that prevent water from draining. A clogged drain can lead to puddling inside the dishwasher that eventually leaks out the bottom of the door. If that is not causing the issue and the lower spray arm does not solve the problem, then you may need to check the overflow control switch, part number PS11750031. If it is faulty, you may need to replace it. We hope this helps!"

Removed wire from heating element, removed (broken) brass nut, unclipped heating element and removed. Removed flat washers and replaced with new grommets. Kind of tricky getting them in there. Also had to lube them with silicone to get the element back through. Installed new brass nuts and installed wire connectors. Reset breaker and started dishwasher to verify repair.

The middle spray arm changes out in a jiffy, with just a phillips screwdriver. The lower spray arm nut was stuck so I used pliers to turn the screw and remove it. While you have the lower spray arm off, clean out food scraps and mineral deposits from the drain. The instructions say that if you remove the pump assembly you will need a new seal, so leave the pump on unless you order the appropriate parts. Clean all surfaces with a cleaner that can remove calcium deposits. Read less"

There are two slip on wire terminals on each end of the heater element accessible from the back that need to be removed. One of them was badly rusted from leaking water, which had caused the short, a nd had to be replaced. These terminals and the crimping tool to install them are available at any home center. I removed and discarded the old plastic nuts since one of them was damaged by arching from the short circuit. Moving around to the front of the dishwasher, I removed the old heater and installed the new one. I had ordered new rubber washers, but the new heater came with them already installed. Since one of the old ones failed and caused the leak, they are a good thing to keep around as spares anyway. I installed the new nuts and tightened them to enough to ensure that the washers made a good seal. I reconnected the wire terminals to the heater, reconnected power and moved the unit back into place. The circuit opening when the heater failed caused a \"call for service\" error and the controller would not allow the unit to run. You will know you have this by the \"CLEAN\" LED flashing seven times. Clear the diagnostics by pressing the buttons for \"HEATED DRY\", \"NORMAL\", \"HEATED DRY\", \"NORMAL\" and after the controller resets, the dishwaher is ready to run. It's worked like new ever since. Read less"

It leaves water droplets on the dishes.Once I got the rubber screw on attachment installed the dishes are clean & dry now & no water dropplets on the dishes.The water dispenses up to the top like it suppost to throught the small tube to wash the upper rack dishes.The wife is happy now she doesn't have to clean & dry them by hand.Thank's so very much!!Now on to the next project in hand to submit later on.

        "repairInstruction": "I had the front right burner and back left burner always click, but never light without help from a match or lighter. So I saw how you can use rubbing alcohol to clean the ignitors with a Q-Tip. I did that, but the ceramic on the back left ignitor broke off with just a gentle cleaning. I ordered a replacement ignitor which came quickly. W hile waiting I had to try to get off the burner, as the Torx (star) screws were both not budging even with a little WD40. I ended up drilling both screws out. When the ignitor came I replaced it quite easily. However, all five burners started clicking and kept on clicking once I plugged the cooktop back in. Problem number two - the Spark Module or wiring had a problem. It was the Spark Module and I'll describe that repair with the next installation s=instruction I fill out. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Ignitor switches shorted out",
        "repairInstruction": "The ignitor switches are installed on top of the 4 gas valves for the range top. These switches control the electronic ignition. To replace the switch assembly the top of the range must be removed to gain access. This was made more difficult by the fact that the screws that hold the burners to the range top were rusted and had to be drilled out so the the burners could be released from the top. 1. Disconnect the power to the range.2. Open the top oven door. 3. Remove 2 - 1/4\" sheet metal screws at the front corners of the range top assy. Remove the Burner knobs and the two Phillps screws that holds the gas valve assembly to the range top. 4. With a drill, remove the tops of the screws to release the burners from the range top. If the screws are in good condition and just unscrew them and the upper burners from the Orifice Holders. (I had to replace the orifice holders because the screws were stuck in them due to rust). 5. When the burners are free, lift the range top at the front and remove it from the range. Disconnect the ignitor wires from the ignitors on each holder. 6. To replace the Orifice Holders, disconnect the gas supply pipes from each holder by loosening the compression nut at the holder using an adjustable wrench. Secure the Orifice Holders when loosening the fittings, BE CAREFUL not to damage the aluminum gas supply pipes.7. Note that there are 3 different Holders, be sure to use the holder that matches the specific location. 8. For LP gas fueled ranges ONLY, remove the small gas jets from the old holders and install them in place of the parts supplied with the new orifice holders. The new parts contain NATURAL GAS jets which are not compatible with LP gas. Each Different Orifice Holder uses a specific orifice or jet, make certain that the orifice matches the orifice holder. Check for leaks at the gas connections using soapy water.9. Carefully raise the old ignitor switches (4) off the shafts of the gas valves. Note the top and bottom configuration of the switches 10. Carefully release the wires that come from the rear of the range from the rearmost switch. Press a suitable pin or other suitable tool in a the hole, beside the wire, just enough to release the wire. (Look at the NEW switch assemble to see how this works). Remove the wires from the NEW switch first to see how it is done. Repeat the process on the old switches. (you will re-use the wires that come up from the rear of the range.11. Install the new switch assembly over the four (4) burner gas valves, take care to align the \"D\" shaped shafts with the holes in each valve.12. Insert the wires in the two connections on the rearmost switch. CAUTION!!! Be sure to install the wires so that the color codes agree with the wires on the new switch assembly. Black to black and gray to gray.13. Install the 4 clear plastic \"shields\" over the shafts and against the top of each switch.14. Re-connect the ignitor wires to the burners and Re-Install the range top, in the reverse order of dis-assembly. Read less"

If the catch you are replacing has an 18 on it or if it is silver, use the 020 yellow catch. If nothing matches check if your dryer has one catch, and make sure it is not a 27\" Wide Laundry Center or a Commercial Stacked Pair and if that is true, use the 020 yellow catch. If it is either of those types of machines, use the 025 green catch. If your dryer has two catches, use the 022 blue catch on the top and the 020 yellow catch on the bottom.\n\nI hope this helps."

When i push the start button, there is a loud click, the whirring stops, but the dryer does not start.  Do these symptoms give any indication of which part might be faulty?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Erin,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a couple of other parts that you would check to see if they are working correctly. The first part I would actually suggest testing is your start switch. You may also want to test your thermal fuse as well. You can test both parts with a multi meter to see what the continuity is on them. If both of those parts are fine you might go on to test your thermostats and your element as well. If those parts are fine then it may be your timer that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Morgan, thank you for your question. These would be the instructions from the manufacturer: This kit contains (2) door strikes and various door catches. Some dryers may use more than (1) catch. Note numbers stamped on the catches and/or color of the spring steel, 20 (yellow), 22 (blue) or 25 (green). Match the number and/or color, of the catch being replaced with the catch supplied in the kit. If the catch you’re replacing has an 18 stamped on it or is silver in color, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. The (2) door strikes contained in the kit are the same. Please replace the door strike(s) with the appropriate number of door catches being used for this repair. If you cannot match the number on the catches, match the catch(es) by the following: 1. If your dryer has one catch and is not a 27” Wide Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. If it is a 27” Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 25 (green) for replacement. 2. If your dryer has 2 catches, use the catch stamped with 22 (blue) on the top and the catch stamped 20 (yellow) on the bottom.  I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jamie. This is the correct assembly WPW10130695 for your white dishwasher, and it includes everything you need to replace the handle. To begin this repair, unplug your dishwasher or disconnect the power. You will want to remove the screws that are holding the inner door to remove the inner door panel. You will see wires leading to the old latch assembly, remove them and the assembly. Using the same steps but backwards you can connect the new assembly, put it back in place, and reattach the inner door panel. Good luck with this repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi David, great question. You are right, the only way to open a jammed door would be to lift the door and with controlled movements to jerk it outwards. Before attempting this, we recommend checking the dishwasher to make sure it is properly mounted so that the jerking movement does not slide it out of place and hurt the dishwasher. Otherwise, by doing this you will not be at risk for breaking anything. Just be careful and give yourself some space. I hope this helps."

        "repairInstruction": "Initial inspection of the issue and research suggested the door latch was malfunctioning / broken. I bought the part and expressed it home. The installation involved removing the door screws on the inside of the door, separating the front and back panels, unplugging the door latch, removing it from its niche and popping in the new one. Re verse the take apart and it was done. Very simple swap. Hardest part was juggling the two halves of the door and preventing the door for trying to close in the process as the bulk of the weight is in the outside half of the door. The new part did not fix the issue. The door strike was the next part that could be broken / malfunctioning. I ordered that part as well and replaced it. In the process of replacing it I found that the original door strike had been installed upside down. I am guessing it was installed at just the right pitch, or maybe even bent at the manufacturing facility, so that it latched. No idea how it managed two years like that. I installed the new one correctly and the door latches perfectly. Both parts I removed from the unit I will retain if my new parts should fail in the future. Read less"

The door does not appear to be securing as well as it was before this happened, and there is no external handle.  Do you think that the door latch has become defective in this situation.  I have checked the \"tab\" that the latch connects to and it appears to be ok.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Everett, Thank you for the question. The light blinking sequence will indicate which part or parts on your Maytag dishwasher need to be replaced or checked. If you can watch the lights and let us know the sequence we will be happy to take a look and see what part might be defective. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Synithia, \n\nThank you for your question. Yes, if your latch is the part that is causing you any issues then it would probably need to be replaced. You could take a quick look at your catch as well. The metal piece that the latch clips into. Just check to see if it is damaged at all. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi John,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is not starting, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the door latch, the strike, the door balance link kit, the turbidity sensor, the motor and the electronic control board.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Brandon, thank you for your question. I would recommend testing the latch switches before ordering the panel. If the start button is lit up but the unit won't start, the latch switches may not be functioning properly. These switches, when activated, tell the unit that its ok to start the wash cycle. If the switches are not the issue, then the control panel would be the next step. I hope this helps!"

Tells me the latch is the problem. Does this sound correct to you?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ivan, thank you for writing. When testing the Door Latch with a multi meter it should read as zero when functioning properly. If it reads higher than zero then the switch is faulty and should be replaced. For this symptom you will want to consider either the Door Balance Link Kit part PS972325 or the Pump Motor part PS11773089 for your model. We hope this helps."

The screws holding the latch in place are tight. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Tom, Thank you for the question. The latch does not control the dispenser. The dispenser has a small red wax motor on the back that tells the dispenser to open and release the detergent or the rinse aid. If the rinse aid cap is not opening, you may need to have the dispenser replaced. You can also remove and check the rinse aid cap to see if there has been any wear or damage that would prevent it from opening. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Scott,\nThank you for your question.  Try cutting power to the dishwasher for 5 minutes and turning it back on.  If this does not help, you may need to test the electronic control board with a multimeter to see if it is working correctly.  If the dishwasher will still not start, some other parts that you will need check are the pump, the sump and motor assembly, the capacitor, the door latch, the turbidity sensor and the touchpad.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

This dishwasher is probably 20 years old or older and plastic gets really brittle wit h age. The left side came out a little easier than the right one. When I got brave and tugged harder I managed to break the offset contact inside of the plug. Just gave it one desperate powerful tug wit my pliers and out it came, thank goodness the plug itself wasn't damaged. Put assembly in place, ligned up the screw holes in the door panel, put screws back. Works like a charm. The black color of the handle does not perturb me, It is recessed and only shows when dishwasher is running. By the way I'm a 75 year old female and am rather proud of myself. Lol Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jerry, thank you for reaching out. Try pressing the start or reset pad to reset the dishwasher and wait 2 minutes. If the problem persists, then you may need to check the door latch, part number PS6447681, to fix the issue. The door latch is attached to the tub frame and connects to the door strike to keep your dishwasher door closed during operation. If you have a broken or faulty door latch, your dishwasher door may not stay closed, and this can prevent the dishwasher from running. We hope this sorts out your problem!"

The dishwasher comes on, the lights come on, I hit start and it will sound like it’s going to start then it will make the 3 beep noise it makes when the door is left open.",

You will need to check the door latch again, but also the door strike, the detergent and rinse dispenser, the door spring, the spring linkage, the bottom door gasket and the tub gasket.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ken,\n\nFirst and foremost, make sure to unplug your appliance and turn off the water supply. You will have to remove all of the screws holding the inner door panel to the outer door panel. You should then be able to pop off your old latch. If the wire harness is hard to remove from your latch you can use a flat head screw driver to help push the plugs off of the old terminals. Make sure to replace your handle as this part does not come with your handle already attached. After you have done that, just follow these steps in reverse to put your appliance back together. I hope that helps!"

He was very nervous about taking on the project, the longest part was testing to make sure it worked(running a cycle).The simply pulled out the dishwasher, after disconnecting all electrical power, drained the rest of the water that we couldn't see from above, following the video given took out the old part without needing to take out the motor and were able to replace the drain pump, put everything back together besides sliding it into place in case it didn't work, in less than 15 minutes! When the short cycle finished and the water had drained they put it back into place and ran an energy saver cycle and it worked like a charm! Since then(2 weeks ago) we have now ran every function and have had no issues! Every time we open the dishwasher we comment on how much we missed having a dishwasher! Haha! Read less"

It took a while but eventually it made it through to the dishwasher basin. But it still didnt drain.\n\nI then removed the drainpipe and re-attached. I never found anything that would clog it. But when I reassembled it, it worked. But again yesterday it stopped draining again. But I would try to re-attach some of the wires and it would eventually work. But sometimes would stop in the middle of running, with lights flashing or it all would go dark. Again, I'd \"play\" with the wire connections underneath a bit and it would eventually run through. I have no idea if any of my write-adjusting is having an effect or not.\n\nBased on my search here, it may need a drain pump assembly replaced, but is there any other troubleshooting I can do before I go that route to be sure that is the issue?\n\nThank you for your time - I appreciate the assistance.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Aaron, thank you for contacting us. Before replacing the drain pump, we would recommend checking the wire connections of the pump and making sure no connection is loose or damaged. Also, check the drain pump filter, part number PS11770489, and ensure that it is not damaged or clogged. If this does not help, replacing the drain pump, part number PS8689824, is the most likely solution. Customer service is always available to help you place an order if you are having trouble doing so. Good luck with your repair."

I would suggest checking your door latch switches just to make sure they are working. If they are not the machine may think the door is open and will not go into the automatic drain cycle. However, if that part is working then it may be your control board that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The If there is water left over at the end of the cycle, I would suggest checking the water inlet valve to be sure its not leaking into the unit, the float switch and the drain pump itself.

If the motor does not run during the drain cycle, or if it simply hums instead of running, it may need to be replaced. Also check the drain hoses to see if they are clogged. Lastly, look at the sump pump check valve. If it is stuck closed it will keep the water from draining. Clean that out and replace it if it is necessary.\n\nI hope this helps."

I first ordered from you and replaced the drain pump but problem was still there. Then the clean led blinking 7 times was pointing to a heating problem so i replaced the bi-metal fuse and heating elements. But problem is still there.

If you disconnect power from the dishwasher, you can test the turbidity sensor at connection P12 of the control board. From pin 1 to pin 3, you should get a resistance reading between 46 to 52 K Ohms. If the resistance is not within this range, then you will need to replace the sensor. Hope this helps!"

My only problem was lining up the chopper blade, with the need to install on an angle and connect copper assembly with the motor, and align with groove, needle nose pliers did not work for me, due to the fact, pliers seemed to angle the chopper assembly a nd did not received equal pressure between the blade and the screen.( I did not have a collection of needle nose pliers to chose from) I used a fork to give even pressure distribution and keep the assembly even and it slipped right into position, remembering to line up all connections between the motor and the chopper assembly, the fork give me the ability to angle the assembly. Its like having a new dishwasher, I use the light setting now when washing a load. Saved $$$$$$$ and X-mas is on the way!!! Thanks Parts Direct!!! Will re-order when the next appliance repair occurs.

The blockage paralyzes the work of this part, making draining impossible or at least difficult. The impeller of the pump is damaged or worn out.

It keeps the seals from drying up and your dishwasher will pump it out immediately before you start a new load. However, if there is more water, we recommend checking the dishwasher filter, part number PS11759673.

You may notice this water when you remove your dishwasher filters for regular cleaning. This small amount of water is drained when you start your next cycle and is replaced with fresh water.

        "repairInstruction": "According to your site, the part(s), to consider, to resolve the problem were: 1.Motor Assembly DC Pump, OR 2.Drain Pump. I simply selected the drain pump because it was cheaper and because it was making a clicking noise. (The only significant noise that this dishwasher was making) To be safe, I unplugged the unit and turned off the w ater, under the sink. I removed the kick plate and I unscrewed the anchor clips from under the counter and carefully pulled the unit out. I then opened the dishwasher and removed the lower rack. To minimize water clean-up, I took a rag and soaked up the standing water in the bottom until it was nearly dry. I then tipped the dishwasher on it's left side, knowing where the location of the drain pump (front, right), would be in an easier location for me to work. I first unplugged the pumps wiring. Then, with pliers, I was able to disconnect the clips on the short, rubber hoses that hold the pump in alignment.(Use caution: If reusing the same rubber hose(s) on the new pump, it will be easier if you put them on in the same direction as they were take off) Then I removed the rubber supports off their hooks, that allow the pump to hang from the bottom of the dishwasher. Once the rubber hoses are re-connected on the new pump and placed on to it's former proper alignment, you can re-attach the rubber supports to their hooks. And last, but not least, remember to plug the new pump's wires back in place. Carefully stand up dishwasher and push it slowly back into place. I plugged in the unit and turned on the water. Before I screwed the unit back to the counter and kick plate back on the front, I ran a load and watched for leaks beneath the new pumps area. No leaks. \"Easy, Peasy\". Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Stopped circulating water from sprayer arms",
        "repairInstruction": "The repair is easy for most if you have basic skills. 1. Cycle your unit to make sure all the water in the tub is emptied. (Start a cycle then cancel it which forces it to empty)2. Turn off the power at the circuit/fuse panel & also turn off your water supply going to the unit which is usually under the sink with y our sink plumbing.3. Have a few old towels handy, there will be a little water but nothing that requires a wet shop vac, etc. 4. Remove the bottom kickplate (should be a screw on each side of the front of unit)5. Disconnect the power supply wiring to make removal easier.6. Disconnect the water supply line (have a towel handy there will be a little water in the supply line)7. Unscrew the mounts either at the top and/or sides of the washer depending on the install method into your cabinetry. 8. Carefully slide out the unit. 9. Carefully turn the unit on its side or upside down depending on your preference to work on the underside where the pump is located. Again have a towel or two handy there will be some water that leaks out from the tub even after forcing an empty cycle. 10. The circulation pump is easy to remove. First plug the power line, there is a clip to disengage to separate the plug. A small flat screwdriver will help. 11. If this is a first time being replaced it will probably have crimp style hose clamps on the two lines coming off the pump. Again a small screwdriver will help pry it apart. Throw these away your pump kit will have new hose clamps for installation.12. Once these clamps are removed you can slip the hoses off and the pump will be free to remove from the unit. 13. Installation is easy. Make sure the rubber hoses seal completely around the unit before clamping. Pay attention to make sure its sealed evenly, your unit will leak water otherwise once its functioning again. 14. My recommendation is to reassemble, slide the unit back into your cabinetry and hook your power and water supply up. Before you screw the unit back into place and close up the bottom panel, start a quick cycle. Within that first minute when the unit is filling and starting the circulation pump you can watch underneath and make sure your circulation pump lines are sealed and not leaking. Once satisfied, you can then stop the unit and finish securing the unit with mounting screws and closing up the bottom kickplate panel. Good luck! You can do this :) Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Wash pump stopped spraying the dishes. In all fairness I neglected to clean the filter since I purchased it.",
        "repairInstruction": "Started by removing dishwasher, including disconnecting power, water and drain line. Then turned washer on back. Electrical connector to old wash pump was a little tricky to remove as the release tab isn’t straightforward, I used a tiny screwdriver and jiggled it around till it came loose. The factory hose clamps (2) are crimped on, but if you can find the tail end you can work them loose with a screwdriver by prying the tail up from the body of the clamp. Once you have the electrical connector and the two clamps removed, the pump comes of easily with a twisting motion. The new wash motor came with new clamps (2 extra). When sliding the rubber boots on the new pump in place, it will require a twisting motion to position it correctly, make sure (I didn’t and had to go through the whole process twice) that the rubber boot is not folded under on the bottom where it’s hard to see. Tighten clamps carefully and don’t over tighten. Plug in electrical connector and you’re ready to reinstall dishwasher. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "No washing action during the wash cycle, the machine still filled and drained",
        "repairInstruction": "The installation is fairly straightforward, basically one plug in electrical connection and two plumbing connections. The smaller of the two plumbing connections can be tricky because of the hose clamp... The original clamps are one time use crimp style. The replacements are standard hose clamps, which means the section where the tensi on mechanism is, is a bit wider than the clamp itself... This can cause the rubber collar on the dishwasher to slide off/separate from the pump part itself when tightening the hose clamp. If you are careful and align things just right, it will work like a charm. The best advice I have is to take your time and make sure the connections are snug without being too tight, otherwise it could leak and/or something else could break. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Casey,\nThank you for your question.  To clean the filter, you will first have to remove it from the dishwasher.  Once removed, soak the filter in warm soapy water for 10 minutes and replace.  Remove the baskets and pour one cup of vinegar on the bottom of the dishwasher followed by a cup of baking soda.  Let it stand overnight and run an empty cycle the following morning.   When the cycle is complete, scrub away any remaining dirt from the bottom of the dishwasher.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "What should the electrical resistance be across the leads of the motor?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dan,\nThank you for your question.  To test the motor with a multimeter, disconnect the motor's two wire leads from the wiring harness. Set your multimeter to the R x 1 setting. Touch each of the meter's probes to one terminal each. Your motor should show little resistance (a reading of zero, or close to zero).  Now check the ground connection. Place one probe on the bare metal housing of the motor. Place the other probe on each terminal, one at a time. You should not receive any reading on your meter from this test. If your dishwasher's motor fails either of these tests, you will have to replace it.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

You can also check the spray arms to see if the holes the water sprays through are clear. It is common for them to get clogged over time. You can try to run a empty load and add a cup of vinegar to the water and it will help clean the spray arms. Next you can you start the cycle and after the water fills, open the door to see if the water is at the proper level and the water should be fairly hot so there should be lots of steam. Hope this helps!"

Replacing the drain pump is easy and can be done at home. The drain pump is located at the bottom of the dishwasher. Un-thread the screws on each side of the door that hold the outer panel, and remove the panel. Remove the access panel by un-threading the screws. Once you removed the access panel, you will have access to the drain pump. Take the wire harness out of the connector. Press in the locking tab on the top and turn the pump clockwise to remove it. To install the new pump, you may follow the instruction backward. We hope this solves your problem!"

Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers. To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes. How Buying OEM Parts Can Save You Time and Money",

        "customerQuestion": "How do you check the heating element for continuity?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jeff, thank you for your question. To test the element, locate your dishwasher's heating element. Open the dishwasher door and look into the tub. It is the thin, circular tube at the base of your dishwasher. It may or may not be covered. If it is covered, remove the lower dishrack, and then remove the cover.\n\nYour heating element is going to have two metal terminals. One at each end. Each terminal reaches downwards, into the base of the dishwasher. Mentally mark the area where each terminal enters the base of the tub.\n\nNow you need to gain access to the heating element's wiring. You can do this by first removing the lower kickplate panel of the dishwasher. There will be at least two screws (but maybe four) holding the kickplate panel in place. They are located either on the top or the bottom of the panel. If the screws are located on the top, you may need to open the dishwasher door in order to gain access to them. Close the door to remove the panel, though.\n\nNow look into the lower access area that you have just uncovered. Pinpoint the area where the heating element terminals extend through the base of the dishwasher. They will each have a wire connected to it. Label each of the wires so that you will be able to properly reconnect them later. Now you can pull the wires off the terminals.\n\nEach wire is connected to a terminal using a slip-on connector. Grasp the connector and pull on it firmly. DO NOT pull on the wire itself. Pull only from the connector. You may decide you need to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you.\n\nUse your multitester (aka multimeter) to test the heating element for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each meter probe to a terminal. You should receive a reading somewhere in between infinity and zero. Because of the variety of makes and models of dishwashers, it is quite difficult to say exactly what the reading should be for each and every possible model. However, if the test you conduct produces a reading of infinite resistance (meter's needle does not move), then that is indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours. Similarily, if the test you conduct produces a reading of zero resistance (meter's needle moves to the other extreme of the scale), then that is also indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours.\n\nYou do not have to remove the heating element from the dishwasher in order to test it. Just make sure power is not getting to your dishwasher before you conduct the test. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Sri, Thank you for your inquiry. To pull the dishwasher out from under the countertop. Shut off the electricity at the breaker. Tip: place a piece of tape over the breaker switch to ensure no one turns it on while you're working. Turn off the water under the sink. Take off the front cover at the bottom of the dishwasher to expose the wiring. Use a voltage meter to test the wires at the dishwasher to ensure the power is still off. Remove the electrical box from the unit. Unscrew the wire nuts and pull apart the wires. Start with the green wires, white and then black. Disconnect the drain line from the dishwasher and the water supply line from the dedicated dishwasher stop. Open the door to the dishwasher, then remove the screws secured to the underside of the countertop. Raise the legs using a wrench. Slowly pull out the dishwasher ensuring the wires are out of the way. Also, the drain line should come out with the dishwasher from under the sink. Tip: Place a drop cloth or piece of cardboard in front of the dishwasher to prevent scratches on the floor. Also, before turning electricity back on, make sure to tape or cap off the ends of the three exposed wires. Although we do not have a repair video for this exact model for the heating element, I have included a video link for a similar Whirlpool heating element. Hope this helps!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co8dQ7rzTMQ&index=25&list=PLD984081941E1E8CD"

        "customerQuestion": "Dishwasher does not dry.  Testing heating element and thermostat for continuity, both test ok, although heating element doesn’t show complete continuity(0.08 ipo 0.00). Should i still suspect the heating element?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Joe. Thanks for your question. The issue could be the electronic control board is PS11731265 - this is rarely the issue, but it could be worth cutting off power to the dishwasher for one minute and then restarting it to see if that fixes the issue before replacing the board. The heating element should read between 8 and 30 ohms. If the element is testing good, I would suggest checking the thermostat, part number PS11750035. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Stephen,\nThank you for your question.  For this repair you will need to use a Phillips head screwdriver and a ½ inch wrench.  Before beginning any repair, please turn the water off and either unplug the appliance or turn the circuit breaker off.   To begin the repair, open the door and remove the lower dishrack.   Then remove the lower spray arm by pulling it straight up.   Use the screwdriver to unthread the screws securing the dishwasher to the counter and then pull the dishwasher out half-way.   Then remove the wires from the heater terminals.  Take note of how they are positioned before removing them.  Then, with the half inch wrench, unscrew the mounting nuts securing the terminals.  Then pull out the old heater terminals and release the heater terminals from the retaining clips.  Install the new heater element terminals into the openings.  There should be 2 white dots on the heating element.  Where the white dots are positioned is where they slide into to the retaining clips.  Once the element has been placed into the clips, push the terminals down and reinstall and tighten the mounting nuts with the wrench.  Place the wires back onto the terminals and slide the dishwasher back into the counter.  Secure the dishwasher to the counter with the 2 screws.  Reinstall the lower spray arm and push it down to lock it in.  Place the lower rack back into the dishwasher and restore power and water to the dishwasher.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

        "customerQuestion": "This is a fairly new dishwasher. A plastic utensil fell into the tub and melted against the element.  I ran it again and the controls respond and the cycle seems to run correctly but when i open it mid-cycle i don't get the wave of hot air and moisture that i used to get and at the end dishes and the tub aren't are dry as usual.The element appears to be intact.  i can neither see nor feel any break in it, the plastic seems to have fallen off but there is a white residue on the element (maybe undissolved detergent?).  it doesn't make sense to me that the plastic should have damaged the element.\n do i risk damaging the control panel if the element is damaged and i run the washer?\nfinally:  i watched the video and was puzzled that the technician said it was easier if the machine was pulled out and why does the water need to be disconnected?\nthanks for your help.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Bob,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is not drying the dishes properly, the heating element may need to be replaced even though it does not appear to be damaged.  You may also need to check the thermostat as well to make sure it is working correctly.  Both of these parts can be tested with a multimeter.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "repairInstruction": "So one day passing the dishwasher while it was running, I noticed a rather pungent burning smell. Yikes, I shut it off!I took apart the pump housing at the bottom inside the dishwasher, expecting to find some kids toy plastic bit had got caught and had jammed the motor or something. But nothing there, and my dishwasher has a little screen to keep just such things from getting to the pump anyway. Hmmm.So, ran the dishwasher again, seemed ok now.A week later, same thing, burning smell. Pull it apart again, but no sign of trouble. But I know something is up, so I pull the kickplate and have a look underneath... Way at the back I see a red wire that looks a little melted, but it's hard to tell, so I pull the whole dishwasher out. Sure enough, one of the heater wires is melted and burned, and the plastic locknut holding that side of the heater is badly scorched. Looks like a little electrical fire, I'm lucky it didn't get out of hand!The heater still tests ok with an ohmeter, but I don't trust it now - order the heater and replacement locknut and washers. Didn't need to order washers, they come with the heater, oh well.Heater removal and replacement is very straight forward, but I added some high-temp gasket silicone sealant (Ultra Blue) around the seals as I think the original problem may have ben a bit of water leakage causing a short.Took about an hour to pull the dishwasher out, remove the heater and install the new one, put a new terminal on the heater wire, and put the whole thing back under the counter.Working great now. But not a problem I expected to have with a 2-year-old dishwasher! Read less"

Any ideas what would cause this, and is it an issue that i need to replace the heating element?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Kurt,\n\nThank you for your question. Usually when something like this happens with your bake element it means that something has dripped on the element. Which may be the reason that the part has stopped working. It sounds like you will have to replace your bake element, but you can test it with a multi meter to double check if it is working or not. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Eileen, thank you for your question. There are a few parts that could be the issue. The Heating Element Assembly is one. If lights are flashing on the control panel, the heating element assembly might have burned out. The heating element assembly heats the water up to operating temperature. After a set amount of time if the temperature isn't reached a light on the control panel might start flashing. The heating element assembly can be checked for continuity with an Ohm meter.\nDrain Pump - If lights are flashing on the control panel, the drain pump might not be working properly. For two-wire drain pump motors check them for continuity using an Ohm meter. If it's defective You'll need to replace it. Drain pumps are not repairable. Touchpad and Control Panel - If the lights are flashing on the display the entire touchpad and control panel assembly might be defective. If the display works but the dishwasher functions are all out of synch, or some of the buttons don't respond properly the entire touchpad and control panel might need to be replaced.I Hope this helps!"

If this does not help, there may be an issue with the door switch.  Try opening and then closing the door firmly and selecting a new wash cycle to see if this resolves the issue.  If not the door switch will need to be replaced.  Try cleaning the control panel to see if this helps.  Sometimes a key may be stuck and wiping the control panel with a cloth may help.  If the light continues to blink, then you will need to replace the electronic control board.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.

I also noticed that flood switch asm part states that it controls hot and cold water.   Could it be both parts that cause the water to be cold?  Thank you",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Eric,\nThank you for your inquiry.  You are correct.  It could be either the heating element or the flood switch assembly.  You will need to check the parts with a multimeter to see which one is causing the issue.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "I'm still not getting hot water (the water is probably 130 degrees) nor are the dishes drying.  I checked the heating element with multi-meter and it shows 17ohm for continuity.  I didn't know how to check the flood switch assembly with a multi-meter so i'm not sure about it.  I did remove the flood switch and clean it (it had a lot of \"gunk\" built up in it that only removed when i placed it under boiling hot water).  How would i check the flood switch with a multi-meter to know if i need to replace it?  Also, would there be any other parts i should check to fix the no hot water and not drying problem? Thank you very much!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Eric, \n\nThank you for your question. We have a page that details how you can test that switch: https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher+test-float-switch+repair.htm . However this switch usually has to deal with your appliance being able to fill with water and drain the water. You have checked your heating element, the only other part that it may be is the electronic control board. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

      {
        "customerQuestion": "The original problem was no water, tested the inlet valve and it was fine, replaced the float switch and dishwasher is filling with water. Now my problem is that there is no heating, meaning its not drying the dishes, tested the heating element and it test fine 16ohms. I can not seem to see any temperature sensor, according to the web the float switch has two functions, float switch and thermistor; having replace it twice with out a change in heating i'm inclining towards the control board. Its there any other part on this dishwasher that would cause not to heat (dry)?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Julio, thank you for your question. If the heating element and float switch have been replaced, and the valve is allowing hot water into the unit the control board is the most likely issue that is causing the heating element to not function properly. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Rick, \n\nThank you for your question. This installation is an intermediate level installation. You will have to shut the water and the power off to your appliance. You will have to remove the kickplate/access panel at the bottom of your appliance. Then the outer door panel. After that you will have to remove the bracket that would be just behind the kickplate. Once you have all that removed, you will have to remove your lower rack, and your filter and manifold from inside of the dishwasher. Once you have those parts uninstalled, remove the mounting brackets of your appliance and remove the appliance from underneath the counter. You will then gently place it on it's back. This will give you access to the bottom of the appliance. Remove the hose going to the water inlet valve. After that remove your drain pump and sump assembly from underneath your dishwasher. This is where your heater assembly is located. Unplug it from the wiring harness and then reinstall the new part by following these steps backwards. If you are uncomfortable with this installation, I would suggest contacting a certified technician to help you out. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Rosalind,\nThank you for your question.  If you have your dishwasher hooked up to a garbage disposal, you will need to check the drain line.  Turn your disposal on to make sure it is clean and that it is draining correctly.  If it is draining correctly, remove the drain hose and inspect it for any clogs.  If there are no clogs, then the issue lies elsewhere.  If your dishwasher is not hooked up to a garbage disposal, you will need to check the air gap if your sink has one.  The air gap is located near your faucet.  If there is water leaking from it, then this is a sign that it is clogged.  Remove the cap and use a tube to blow air down into it to remove any debris that is trapped there.  If this is not the issue, then you will need to check the dishwasher drain.  If the drain is clogged this would be the reason why you still have water in your dishwasher.  You will need to clean it to resolve the issue.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

Here is a link to one of our YouTube videos that you may reference on how to remove/install the filter, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrwZ2PnkQkk&t=85s.  The dishwasher in the video may be different from yours, but it will give you a general idea on how to install the part. We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

Reach in and pull out the lower rack until it is resting on the door, and then remove it and set it aside. Push down on the filter and twist it counterclockwise. Turn the filter until it stops moving, with the tabs released. Pull the filter out of the dishwasher.\n\nPut the new filter in by setting it into the opening, possibly turn it a bit. Then turn it clockwise to lock it in. Put the lower rack back in by setting it on the door and sliding it in. Close the door, plug in the dishwasher again.\n\nI hope this helps."

It would be a good idea to run a mixture of water and vinegar or a dishwasher cleaning solution. That should help take care of the smell. If it does not, you may have to disassemble the unit some, and clean the discharge tubes, and sump. I hope this helps!"

Is that normal?",

It's there to keep the seals from drying up and your dishwasher will pump it out immediately before you get started on a new load. However, if it does not, you may want to check your drain pump and drain hoses. Hope this helps."

Not always mind you, as sometimes we have had a complete cycle go through with no problems. I'm stumped. Any advice? Control board maybe?  Thanks for your assistance.",

How often should this filter need to be replaced?  It is years old   original.   It is the filter micro, part #00645038.  Also, for some unknown reason, we have a lot of scaling     never had it before    think it came from a new (cheap) dish washing soap.  And yes we are on a well, water is not that hard     never had a problem before now....  appreciate you help.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi James, \n\nThank you for your question. Honestly changing the filter in a dishwasher really depends on how much debris is going through your dishwasher as it is cleaning. It is generally suggested that you just change it as needed. This particular filter has a very fine filter mesh. If it gets too clogged up to clean off then you will likely have to replace it. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

I just figure the control module, because of the push buttons, no longer is able to send the correct signal to the water pump to start.  Any help would be much appreciated",

If those parts are all cleaned out and you are still having the issue you may actually have to replace the pump itself. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

After already replacing the water entry pump, I took off the Filter Asssembly Mesh part (by undoing 8 screws), & found that the pump gasket was somewhat coming apart. Upon waiting for receipt of these two items, I realized that I thought it wasn't getting hot either. Once again, I looked at the provided online diagrams and ordered the heater assembly. After placing the dishwasher on its front again, I traced the connecting wires, marked them for later replacement & removed those & removed the ground wire and pulled out the old heater. Voila', its was rusted in two places. Ordered the heater. Upon receipt, I placed a small amount of Vaseline around the heater gasket prior to inserting fully.

If its missing or jammed it can cause incomplete draining. Pull out the dish racks from the unit so you can access the bottom section of the dishwasher. Remove the spray arm and the filter cover from the bottom of the dishwasher. Remove the ball from the round tube that sits towards the back of the opening. To remove the filter, use some chewing gum, or sticky tack on the end of a straw and insert it into the tube to grab and remove the ball (if its still in the hole). Simply drop the new ball into that hole and reassemble. I hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "I have a 2 1/2 year old GE dishwasher Model # GDT535PSMBSS.  In the small well under the filter, we normally have seen a small orange plastic ball laying in the well directly under the drain filter that we easily remove monthly and clean (the filter - not the ball). Yesterday the orange ball got stuck in one of the drain valves, causing my dishwasher not to work.  I went to the store to see other new GE dishwashers, and none of them have an orange plastic ball in the well directly under the drain filter.  I was able to remove the stuck ball from the valve, but I'm hesitant to reposition it freely in the well directly under the drain filter, as it might get stuck in the drain valve once again when I'm able to reoperate the dishwasher.  Is the orange ball supposed to freely lay in the well directly under the drain filter, or is it supposed to be located elsewhere within the drain filter area?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello John, thank you for reaching out. Based on our research, the filter ball lays freely under the sump filter. You just simply need to drop the ball into that hole. We hope this information helps!"

The plastic (or whatever material it is) covering the holes was torn in a couple of different holes. Realizing that this was not the reason for the loss of pressure I investigated a little more and found that water arm going into the docking station was extremely worn with much play. Water pressure was compromised because of it. I replaced filter and docking station and now its like a new dishwasher again. Saved a dishwasher from the landfill! Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jenn, thank you for your question.  Yes, the faucet adapter  attaches to the faucet and allows you to connect the machine to the tap. Before you install the faucet adapter on your taps, be sure that it fits the coupler on your unit. As per the factory, this is used for faucets with inside or outside threads. For female connection (outside) just remove the washers. This adapter is approximately 1 inch in length, and slightly less than one inch in diameter. This adapter comes with two different thicknesses of rubber washer. You will not need to use both so be sure to determine which thickness works best for your tap before installing it. I hope this helps!"

If you are screwing the adapter up into place on your faucet it should not fall off unless the threads on your adapter are worn out or the threads on your faucet are worn out. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jade, by the sounds of things your dishwasher door has been lifted off the hinge pin. To fix it you must lift the door, and see if you can pop it back on to the hinge pin. If you are not able to, you may need to pull the unit outwards to access the hinge assembly. If you cannot get the door back onto the hinge pin, you may need to replace the hinge assembly because it may be damaged. I hope this helps."

The stops fit in the end of the rails that attach to the inside wall of the dishwasher and prevent the rack from coming all the way out and off the rails. Hope this helps!"

On RHS check lower end of door spring and note in which notch the spring sits. On RHS, grasp white plastic connector (\"hinge bushing\", with spring looped around one end), stretch the spring while carefully lifting other end of connector up, out of slot in door hinge lever. Pry door hinge lever 1/8\" away from DW body while sliding friction sleeve over its end. Work friction sleeve past hinge hook, past wider section, into narrower slot (about 2\" from end of hinge hook). Raise door to closed position. Insert and hold lower (90 degree) end of spring into the same notch that it was originally in (mine was in the 5th from the front). Loop the door end of the spring into one end of the white plastic hinge bushing, then insert the other end of the bushing into the door hinge lever's hook while stretching the spring. It does not require much strength. CAUTION: If the lower end of the spring is not properly inserted and held in the notch, it can pop out and possibly injure you! Repeat for the LHS.

If you are opening the door all the way and it is closing part way on its own, then the door spring tension may not be adjusted correctly.  To adjust the door spring tension first unhook the spring from the rear leg of the dishwasher.  Then with a 5/16\" nut driver or hex socket, remove the screw from the tensioner.  The screw can be put into one of three holes in the front leg of the dishwasher. If the door closes by itself, move the tensioner to a higher number hole and replace screw. I hope this helps.

If your dishwasher door is not shutting correctly, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check hinges, the springs and the hinge arm links.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

I noticed that you could move the plate the bottom of the spring hooked into by unscrewing a lo ng quarter inch hex head bolt and bring the plate forward where I could hook the bottom of the spring into the plate. I had first hung the door spring linkage on the door (looked at the opposite side to see how it was arranged) then onto the top of the spring. The difficult part was keeping the bottom of the spring in its hole in the plate while moving the plate back in place. After I got it past the flange where the bolt screwed in, I screwed the bolt in and pulled the plate back to match the opposite side distance which put tension on the spring. The door now works.

Because there are two door springs, one on either side, I decided to replace both plastic linkages even though only one broke, because it would only be a matter of time before the other plastic link failed and I would have to do the repair all over again. Remove the 2-piece panel at the bottom front of the dishwasher. It's held on by four hex-head screws which also have slots for a Philips screwdriver. The springs can now be seen on both sides of the door, at the bottom. Remove two screws that anchor the dishwasher to the underside of the counter. Gently ease the dishwasher a short distance out from its under-counter recess, just far enough to gain access to the springs. Make sure not to put any excessive strain on the water inlet tubing, drain hose or electric power cable by pulling the dishwasher out too far. Close and latch the dishwasher door so that the springs are in minimum tension. Note the slot that the linkages hook into on the door levers. Hook the small end of the spring into the hole in the metal bracket. Slide the linkage onto the other end of the spring. Stretch the spring to slide the free end of the linkage onto the door lever and into the appropriate slot. Push the dishwasher back into its recess and replace all screws and panels. Read less"

To do that, you have to remove the floor molding (preferably without breaking it) and remove the base coverings (painted metal plates on the bottom of the washer. Unscrew the side gasket plates on the side of the dishwasher (just inside of the doo r) where it attaches to the cabinet and the screws in the braces at the top (inside the door) where it attaches to the counter top. Now you will be able to slide the washer forward to look at the sides where the door springs are. Depending on the floor, you may have to raise the washer's front feet. They screw up. As you pull the washer forward be careful to not mess up the insulation which drapes over the top and sides. You only need to come out 1/3 of the way to see the sides where there is a plastic wheel at the forward bottom corner. As you move the door up and down you can see the hook where the cable goes and further up the side you can see several notches where the spring goes. Hook the cable and bring it around the wheel and attach it to the spring. To reinstall, just follow these directions backwards. Good luck. Read less"

I also had to remove the fitting that held the pulley in place.

So although the repair took less than 30 minutes, the rest of the work took a couple hours. Read less"

The kit includes two door balance links and two door balance mounts with wheels, which will replace both the left and right sides. The only tool needed is a 5/16 nut driver.

It was exactly what I needed and the fix went quickly with no issues.I ordered two of PS8728568 (Mounting Bracket), because on your site for that part it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. (Reference: “Part Description” section). In addition, on that same web page under the “Question and Answers” section it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. However, what I received was, two packages with each package having two brackets in it. It’s understandable, since you need two brackets for each dishwasher.Obviously, this is completely contrary to what your web page states. In reality, each package is sold with a pair of brackets.I have not opened the second package and as such it is completely resaleable. As per your Return Policy , I’d like to request a refund for the second packet of brackets and have you cover the return shipping of that package. Please advise next steps. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Tul,\n\nThank you for your question. Unfortunately we do not have any videos for how to install this part. This kit does come with instructions on how to install it however. You will first disconnect your supply lines from your dishwasher. Unscrew your top mounting brackets from the machine. Pull your dishwasher out. Now you will remove your top brackets. Keep them in case you will need them again. 6 inches down on each side of your dishwasher you will see the little area where your mounting brackets are to be hooked up on. Just insert your brackets. To lock them in place, use a part of plyers to bend the tab a little bit toward the outside. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ann, \n\nThank you for your question. You would want to use this side mounting bracket kit instead of the normal top mounting then. That will keep your appliance in place and keep it from tipping as well. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The part number listed under your model number for the screw is PS11740701.  The part number listed under your model number for the side mounting kit is PS1487167.  I hope this helps.

If you are looking for the tracks that mount to the side walls of the inside of your dishwasher, I have listed that part below for you. You would need to order two if you need both tracks. If you are looking for the parts that directly attach to the rack, those would be the rack adjusters. Good luck with your repair."

When testing your valve, if your meter does not change at all that means that your part has no continuity and will need to be replaced. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Lyman, thank you for your question. The first part you will want to check in this kind of situation is the water fill valve. It sounds like the water valve is stuck in an open position. Checking a water valve is very easy. Use your multitester to test the valve for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each of the meter's probes to a terminal. If you receive a reading of infinity, it means the valve's solenoid is faulty and the valve needs to be replaced. If your valve has two solenoids (four terminals), test the second pair of terminals in the same manner. If either pair of terminals receives a result of infinity, replace the water inlet valve. You do not have to remove the water inlet valve from the dishwasher in order to test it. Just make sure power is not getting to your dishwasher before you conduct the test. If the valve is not faulty, the issue is most likely the control board, as that board is what runs the cycles on the unit and acts like a timer, it could be stuck in a fill setting The water valve for your appliance is part number 154637401 and the board is part number 154886103. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jannell,\nThank you for your question.  If the upper spray arm is not turning, then it is likely clogged with debris and it will need to be cleaned.  To clean the spray arm, remove it from the dishwasher and place it in a solution of dishsoap, 1 cup of vinegar and warm water and let it soak until the debris has loosened.  If there are mineral deposits from hard water, soak it in vinegar. Use an old toothbrush, or other scrubbers to clean the surfaces of the arm. Also, use toothpicks or some other tool that you can use to remove any build up from the holes.  Once the arm has been thoroughly cleaned, reattach it inside the dishwasher.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

        "repairInstruction": "based on advice here, concluded the problem was likely that the part \"Valve-Inlt\" was defective. Our dishwasher intake line is copper and had already developed a partial kink from sometime in the past, so I had to be careful. The final connection to the new part had to happen in place: very close to the floor and underneath, because I did n’t want to stress the copper line. Plus, the shutoff was defective, and it was always leaking while I connected. Awkward. As I was threading on, it started to look like it might be cross-threaded, so I stopped and reversed. Slid the washer back out and disconnected the drain line so I could tip the dishwasher u and inspect. It was going on cross-threaded. Not hard to happen on a metal to a plastic connection. To solve, I carefully made very small bends in the copper inlet line until when it would later be brought up underneath to connect to the inlet valve, it would be as perfectly aligned as possible. This worked. As I tightened, it went a little easier and the leak stopped. A good moment. Tightened a bit more, but didn’t want to overdo it as that can cause other problems. Now the moment of truth: let’s run it. DISHWASHER WORKED AGAIN. Runs fine now and we are glad to have it back. Was satisfying I could do this on my own. The advice and guides here made that possible.

After it was completely off we plugged in the electric to the new part which was very easy since it can only go in one way. We slid the new part in place and attached the black hose. We attached the piece to the frame with the one screw and last we attached the gold (garden hose) connection.

Perhaps bad inlet valve itself??  makes no noise when starting cycle and no water at all inside. any suggestions?",

This does not change for any of the wash cycle options.",

You may also want to make sure the water pressure from your home is good as well. If that is fine you should go on to check for blockages in the filter and tubing of your appliance. Make sure the water is able to flow freely and strongly. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

With a multimeter, set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each of the meter's probes to a terminal. If you receive a reading of infinity, it means the valve's solenoid is faulty and the valve needs to be replaced. If your valve has two solenoids (four terminals), test the second pair of terminals in the same manner. If either pair of terminals receives a result of infinity, replace the water inlet valve. We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

In my case, the water line was soft copper screwed into a brass fitting, and over the last 17 years the nut had seized to the 90 degree fitting. Made me say bad things trying to break it loose while trying to fit my hands and wrenches under the washer.This is important!! Make sure to note the angle of the 90 degree fitting that the water line fits into. If your water line is plastic tubing you will be able to move it around to align it to the fitting but if your water line is copper, the 90 degree fitting must be perfectly aligned or the nut will not start and you will say bad things trying to get it to work.Slide the hose clamp up the discharge hose a couple of inches, using the plyers to squeeze the end of the clamp to open it. Remove the hose by twisting it back and forth until it moves then pull it off of the fitting. Remove the valve and remove the 90 degree fitting positioning it in the new valve exactly as it was in the old valve. I have a bench mounted vice that made it easier tighten the Teflon tape coated threads to the right position. Install the discharge hose and make sure the clamp is near the bottom of the hose to provide a good seal below the bulge in the fitting. Connect the the wire plug and water line, install the valve into the mounting slots and install the mounting screw. Turn the water on and check for leaks.Install the base plates and secure with the two 1/4\" screws.Install the door by cocking the bottom in and the top out to let the bottom fit into the bracket. Hold the door square with the washer and install the screws to keep the door square.Run the machine and keep your fingers crossed. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi David,\nThank you for your inquiry.  You can still repair a 10 year old dishwasher.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the drain pump, the sump pump check valve, the chopper assembly, the drain hose, the water inlet valve, the float switch and the bimetal fuse.  I hope this helps.

        "customerQuestion": "On the fill drain and overfill parts diagram, what is part # 10? Does this component control the amount of water that is filled? If there is an insufficient amount of water in the tub to operate the middle and upper spray bars, could this component be the issue or is it the inlet valve? I am also seeing a water leak from component 10",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Gerry, Thank you for the question. #10 is the Float Switch Kit,  PartSelect Number PS557009. Water that fills your dishwasher lifts the float, and when it reaches a certain level, the float acts as a trigger for the float switch. The float triggers the switch to shut off, thereby shutting off the flow of water into the dishwasher. I would suggest having this replaced if the appliance is not filling properly. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jose, \n\nThank you for your question. We would suggest taking a look at your float switch and your water inlet valve next. It could be that there is too much water getting pushed up into your appliance and perhaps that is why it is leaking. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "Can’t find a replacement “check valve” for hose when water being pumped out of dishwasher.  Dishwasher started not draining, but you could click on the “cancel/drain” feature and empty tub. Now, nothing drains. Was told to view and replace this inline plastic “sensor” which was referred to as a “check valve”, but have been unable to find this part for my Kenmore elite dishwasher model:66513153k701. Thought it might be included in drain hose, but not certain from photos and Kenmore website does not show this part on schematics (at least that i could see); is it possible this is part of the “dishwasher water inlet valve” rather than an inline part in the drain hose? Thanks much",

There’s no way to replace it and it’s not easy to change out anyway. The particles were so small they could have passed through and not harmed the system. A better and more practical place for any filter would be just in front of the inlet that could just pop in every 2-3 years as needed preventatively in 5 minutes. Anyway, I reassembled and tested.

        "repairInstruction": "The sump was very clogged with caulk like crud that we think was a chemical reaction from soap that was used the first two years. When I first started troubleshooting, the sump seemed to be the problem, so I replaced that. There was a small hose on the sump that was broken so it made sense to replace it anyhow.When that didn 't help I put the dishwasher into service mode and observed that there just wasn't enough water to spin the sprayer. Therefore it was a water quantity problem, which can be caused by either the Water Inlet Valve or the Flood Switch.I ordered both the Water Inlet Valve and the Flood Switch, just in case. I replaced the valve first and when that worked I did not install the switch.Installation was performed with the dishwasher still inserted in the cabinet. If you have big hands, pull the dishwasher out. With sockets and nut drivers, I was able to remove the assembly. After pulling it out enough to clear the dishwasher, I was able to get a screwdriver on the outlet side clamp and a wrench on the inlet side hose.My old valve had a 90° elbow on it and that was difficult to remove. Installing the elbow on the new valve was just as bad. The valves don't have enough clearance to get a wrench on them to keep them from turning while the elbow is tightened.TIP: Take a picture of the valve before removing/disconnecting anything. I don't know if the electrical connector can attach either way but I made sure to put it back on exactly the same way it was. Read less"

I could hear it washing and it did drain, but dishwasher will not fill with water on its own.",

        "customerQuestion": "Considering buying new water inlet valve?  The water would not stop running into dishwasher (even with door open) and even when power turned off.  I shut off water and waited.  After 10 minutes i turned water back on and it had stopped.  I don't know what else it could be.  I think if it were the float, the water would have stopped running when i opened the door (and when the power was turned off).  Thoughts?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Daniel, thank you for your question. Yes, if the water continued to run into the unit even after the door was opened and power was off, the water valve is stuck in an open position. I would recommend replacing the water valve to fix this problem! Good luck with your repair!"

What does the inlet valve do and could that be bad.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi John, Thank you for the question. The valve releases water into the tub. If the float did not fix the issue the next part to replace would be the water inlet valve. Hope this helps!"

When the door is open, the noise stops. When the door is closed again the humming noise comes back. Can you help me?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Thomas,\n\nThank you for your question. It sounds like you may want to physically check your drain area. Something may be jammed, like the chopper assembly, your pump and motor mechanism, or your drain pump. You would have to pull out your dishwasher for this and take it apart a bit. I hope that helps.

As mentioned in the video, the original screws are 5/16, but they won't screw into the new bracket (whether trying to attach it to the dishwasher or just trying screw right to bracket as a test).  Did the threading on these change at some point so my original screws won't fit this new replacement part? (it didn't come with screws).  Thanks.",

        "repairInstruction": "I would like to start-off by saying that I love this site . I've never been even remotely dissatisfied with parts I've ordered and the installation videos are awesome! I would recommend this site to anyone looking to repair appliances. Secondly, I am a retired mechanical designer with over 35 years of experience. I have a broad range of design experience in consumer, governmental, industrial and military part and product design. My opinion about the design having to do directly with my appliance is not very high and after talking with another local parts supplier discovered that this particular design is approximately 20 years old. I wonder how many dishwashers are leaking without the consumer realizing they have this problem. I followed the installation instructions provided by this site verbatim and the dishwasher still leaked like a sieve. This in my opinion goes back to my remarks concerning the design. This is a weak design at best and could benefit from an improvement in that area. After I installed the new parts, the push on nut (upon being seated onto the shaft for the drain valve flapper) was loose and spun freely. The push on nut did not properly compress the seal onto and around the flapper shaft nor into the valve housing. Water leaked through the seal as a result. I disassembled all of the parts again and placed a flat washer between the push on nut and the seal, to help compress the seal onto the flapper shaft and into the valve housing. The washer was a stainless steel flat washer with an ID that fit onto the shaft closely, but was a smaller OD than the seal. The washer was about 1/32\" thick. Upon reassembly and observation, the dishwasher leak was stopped with the addition of the flat washer and my issue was resolved. Read less"

I removed the the valve and disassembled and found the inlet filter clogged with calcium deposits. Removed all the calcium deposits blocking the wire mesh filter and disassembled the rest of the valve with no further finding as far as the physical valve goes. I then checked the continuity of the solenoid coil and found its resistance to fluctuate in the meg ohms, i presume that this high resistance is not allowing the coil to properly energize and open the valve.So now my question is, what is the nominal resistance of the coil on a new part?? for reference. thank you in advance for your reply.",

This could be caused by either a faulty or defective Water Inlet Valve part PS259368, the Motor and Pump Kit part PS260801, or the Float Switch part PS260235. Try checking the water pressure to the valve. The water inlet valve requires at least 20 psi to function properly. We hope this helps."

We just moved and nothing was working so I did something that I did not want to do--pay attention to the lower rack and figure out why it had a mind of its own. Well, the Bosch interior is filled with adjustable (that usuall y means problems) fingers. Well, it was not so. A piece was missing that supported the \"hand\" from which the fingers sprang. That support piece cost about a buck and was available and ultimately on my doorstep in a day or three. Take the part out of the bag, snap it on the hand and enjoy dish racks that don't flop around.

I’ve put washers behind the wheels on the dishwasher wheels inside, it helps a little but it is very wobbly because the wheels inside are sticking out further? Can someone please help me! I think when we bought this washer brand new the top rack was possibly switched out??? Your help would be appreciated.",

The issue is with the upper dishrack. Make sure you have a model compatible dishrack. The dishrack that will work with your model is PS12585621. Glad to be of assistance!"

As i read everywhere else, this rack is discontinued and the replacement is rectangle in shape with squared off edges. The correct one has a cutout on the right front corner for the small silverware basket that latches onto the outside of the rack - completing the square edge, the inner silverware basket is therefore shorter than most because of the cutout, also my rack has two sets of adjustable tines, the replacement has only one adjustable tine - so are you sure that this is a new old stock oem basket with the cutout on front right side or is it squared off like all the other replacements from all the other parts distributors?  In other words is the photo correct or outdated from what you are actually selling??",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Chirs, thank you for your question. The lower rack for your appliance model number has been substituted quite a few times. Now this rack is a basic square rack, that has the front two corners \"cut off\" to create an angle on the front corners. It would not come with tines, or rollers. The rollers would have to be ordered separately. This is the only replacement rack that the manufacturer offers as a replacement for the original rack. The picture online, and the video are from an older version of the rack that has since been discontinued. I hope this helps!"

The pump seems to run well, i can see water coming up the rear tube and into the center outlet during one of the cycles. It later speeds up and water goes all the way to the top outlet as well. My upper rack arm boot and outlet gasket all look ok. Could they still be an issue?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi V,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishes in the upper rack are not getting clean, there are a few things that you will need to check to see what is causing the issue.  If the dishwasher does not have enough water pressure then water may not reach the upper spray arm.  Check the water pressure in your home to see if there are any issues and also check the hoses to make sure that they are not bent or clogged.  If the upper spray arm is clogged with food or detergent residue, you will need to clean it. Use a sharp tool like a steel wire or a metal hanger to clean the holes and then soak the arm in vinegar to remove any residue that is inside it.  If the upper spray arm seal breaks, this will cause a leak and prevent the water from spraying from the upper arm.  Check the seal and if it is damaged, replace it.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

Customer service issued a return tag and ordered a second kit, which again was supposed to be two rows. Replacement order arrived with just one. Fortunately, I had expected this and had not yet returned the first kit. Called customer service and told them n ot to expect the return of the first order.This kit is sold as fitting several models of Whirlpool and KitchenAid dishwashers, which I verified that my KA was on the list. A minor installation problem occurred when I discovered that the upright tines of this kit don't have the exact same spacing as the KitchenAid originals. The upright tines need to be exactly half the distance between each of the crossbars on the rack below in order to install the three retaining clips found on each row. With the spacing of these tines, there wasn't quite enough room to install the clips. Fortunately, the retaining clips were manufactured with an excessive amount of shoulder on each one. Trimming off the excess material with a fine-toothed hacksaw blade made the clips narrow enough to be used without compromising their ability to hold the tine rows in place. I've used the machine several times now and the clips are holding everything in place as expected.[img]https://i.ibb.co/9TQB3mC/clips.jpg[/img] Read less"

You may have to lie on your back or use a mirror to see the location of the small clip retaining the plug.3. Unclip and remove dispenser module. Here's the rub: the clips used to retai n the unit in the door panel of my dishwasher are tabs cut in the stainless steel cut-out and rolled back at a 90 degree angle to retain their springiness. They seat against the back edge of three plastic ridges along the top, bottom and one along each side of the dispenser module. The key is to remove the module without permanently bending these tabs, thereby losing their springiness and destroying their ability to clip tight against the new module to hold it in. I had some success slipping 3 pieces of flashing under the stainless tabs along the top and sides of the old module, allowing the plastic retaining ridges to ride under the tabs all together and move forward to disengage the clips without permanently bending the tabs. 4.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Linda,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The detergent dispenser is designed to release detergent into the dishwasher tub during the wash cycles and will typically have two compartments, an unsealed compartment for prewash and a sealed compartment for the main wash cycle. Verify that the dispenser is not simply clogged with caked on detergent and give it a good cleaning if necessary. Also check to make sure that the cover for the dispenser will open easily and is not damaged or broken. Check the release mechanism for worn or defective parts and replace if necessary. The rinse aid dispenser is designed to release rinse aid into the tub during the rinse cycle. Verify that the dispenser is full and is not clogged with detergent and verify that the cap is adjusted properly. The dispensers may be operated by either a mechanical devise or by a bi-metal release or wax motor devise.  The rinse aid cap could be the reason why your dishwasher is not releasing rinse aid. The rinse aid dispensing cap is located on the inner door panel of your dishwasher. The rinse aid cap could be loose and may just need to be refitted, but could also be warped or damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher. Remove the cap from the door and inspect it for signs of melting or warping and replace if need be. If your dishwasher is not dispensing detergent, the spring and hinge pin on the dispenser door could be the problem. The dispenser door is spring loaded, and is held in the closed position by a catch. Check that the spring and pin are not bent or broken and replace if required. If the catch is not releasing the door, then you should inspect the timer, the bi-metal release or the wax motor.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "I ran my dishwasher 3 times. All 3 times after cycle the dispenser door was open and the soap pod was laying in the bottom of the unit still in tact. Obviously dishes did not wash. It seems the dispenser is not opening until the end of the cycle seeing how the soap pod is not dissolved. Any suggestions?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Nick,\nThank you for your question.  The detergent dispenser is designed to release detergent into the dishwasher tub during the wash cycles and will typically have two compartments, an unsealed compartment for prewash and a sealed compartment for the main wash cycle. Verify that the dispenser is not simply clogged with caked on detergent and give it a good cleaning if necessary. Also check to make sure that the cover for the dispenser will open easily and is not damaged or broken. Check the release mechanism for worn or defective parts and replace if necessary. The rinse aid dispenser is designed to release rinse aid into the tub during the rinse cycle. Verify that the dispenser is full and is not clogged with detergent and verify that the cap is adjusted properly. The dispensers may be operated by either a mechanical devise or by a bi-metal release or wax motor devise.  The rinse aid cap could be the reason why your dishwasher is not releasing rinse aid. The rinse aid dispensing cap is located on the inner door panel of your dishwasher. The rinse aid cap could be loose and may just need to be refitted, but could also be warped or damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher. Remove the cap from the door and inspect it for signs of melting or warping. Also, if the water is not hot enough, this can cause the dishwasher not to clean the dishes properly.  Turn the hot water tap on at the sink before starting the dishwasher and let it run for awhile.  Once it is hot enough, start the dishwasher.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dave, it is hard to say, do you have any other symptoms? Perhaps the dispenser is stuck, or faulty, if there are no other symptoms than replacing the detergent dispenser may the correct course of action. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Larry, \nThank you for your inquiry.  There a couple of reasons why your detergent dispenser may not be dispensing correctly.  The rinse aid cap may be lose and just needs to be tightened or it may be warped if it was damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher.  You will need to remove the cap to inspect it.  Also, the spring and hinge pin on the dispenser door could be the problem. The dispenser door is spring loaded, and is held in the closed position by a catch. Check that the spring and pin are not bent or broken and replace if required. If the catch is not releasing the door, then you should inspect the timer, the bi-metal release or the wax motor. I hope this helps with your repair.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Greg,\nThank you for your question.  The detergent dispenser is designed to release detergent into the dishwasher tub during the wash cycles and will typically have two compartments, an unsealed compartment for prewash and a sealed compartment for the main wash cycle. Verify that the dispenser is not simply clogged with caked on detergent and give it a good cleaning if necessary. Also check to make sure that the cover for the dispenser will open easily and is not damaged or broken. Check the release mechanism for worn or defective parts and replace if necessary. The rinse aid dispenser is designed to release rinse aid into the tub during the rinse cycle. Verify that the dispenser is full and is not clogged with detergent and verify that the cap is adjusted properly. The dispensers may be operated by either a mechanical devise or by a bi-metal release or wax motor devise.  Also, The rinse aid cap could be the reason why your dishwasher is not releasing rinse aid. The rinse aid dispensing cap is located on the inner door panel of your dishwasher. The rinse aid cap could be loose and may just need to be refitted, but could also be warped or damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher. Remove the cap from the door and inspect it for signs of melting or warping and replace if need be.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Hi. Is there a simple check to find out why soap dispenser won’t release. Before we buy a new part also this dishwasher is 8 years old  is it worth the investment n time",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Terri,\nThank you for your question.  The detergent dispenser is designed to release detergent into the dishwasher tub during the wash cycles and will typically have two compartments, an unsealed compartment for prewash and a sealed compartment for the main wash cycle. Verify that the dispenser is not simply clogged with caked on detergent and give it a good cleaning if necessary. Also check to make sure that the cover for the dispenser will open easily and is not damaged or broken. Check the release mechanism for worn or defective parts and replace if necessary. The rinse aid dispenser is designed to release rinse aid into the tub during the rinse cycle. Verify that the dispenser is full and is not clogged with detergent and verify that the cap is adjusted properly. The dispensers may be operated by either a mechanical devise or by a bi-metal release or wax motor devise.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Today I ran a quick wash cycle with no dishes or soap. No suds until the rinse cycle. Also the wash indicator and rinse indicator are on at the same time near the end of the cycle and the cycle counts down to 1 and then adds an additional 13 minutes. I suspect in an attempt to clear the suds making me suspect the problem lies with the rinse aid dispenser. After 13 minutes the dishwasher declares the dishes are clean…which they are but suds remain in the tub. What do I need to correct this? The length of time displayed for the speed cycle has recently increased prior to starting the dishwasher. Is this a control board problem? Thanks in advance for any help you are able to provide.",

Then remove the door and set it o n the counter. Flip it over and there is a small plastic cover that has to be removed from the back of it, and it is easily removed by gently pulling on it. Now comes the difficult part. There is a locking piece on it that holds the latch onto the door by interlocking with a piece on the back side of the door. I took a pair of wire snips and just cut the old interlocking piece off. This way I didn't have to try and slide the two interlocking pieces apart. When you go to put the new piece on before you interlock them make sure they are put on right. Specifically the latch is pointing the right way to seal the detergent door. Otherwise it can be a pain to separate the interlocking pieces again. (which is why I cut it off the old one). Then you're done. Just put it all back together. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Detergent and Rinse Dispenser door latch completely worn out.",
        "repairInstruction": "I am NOT an appliance technician. I am simply a somewhat handy homeowner. Removal of outer door panel requires removal of two screws from inside the top of the door assembly at the latch, as well as all of the obvious mating screws from around the perimeter of the inside of the door assembly. Use a #15 torx driver bit. Pull top of panel o ut (away from the machine) by maybe two inches, then lift the outer panel up to clear the bottom end of it from the lower positioning brackets. DO NOT lever the top of the panel outward. Keep it close to the inner door. It may take bit of an upward tug to dislodge. Careful here - the outer panel will simply fall free. Two wire pigtails that are connected to components on the inner door are short, so be careful not to strain them after dislodging the outer panel. One is connected to the dispenser. Disconnect both as to provide good clearance for the component replacement. The main wire harness is of sufficient length as to not cause a problem. The six 3/16 hex head screws holding the dispenser in place are easy to remove. There are two small sheet metal tabs that keep the device in place after the screws are removed, but a rectangular mounting frame or bezel will come off, along with the little black curtain that protects the unit. The tabs are at upper left and lower right at the perimeter of the opening in the inner panel. They must be levered gently as to allow the dispenser to push inward for removal. After removal, spend some time cleaning the inner surface of the inner panel as to ensure that the new device will make a watertight contact when fastened in place. Bend the tabs slightly back to an inward position, and install the new dispenser with the socket and motor to your left as you look at it from outside the machine. It clicks in to place and stays put. The bezel mounts only one way (in terms of being upside down) and the flat surface must be toward the inner door. Re-positioning the little black curtain is tricky but if you follow the marks in the material from the previous mount it should work out OK. Tighten the screws evenly as to ensure a good seal. Move the outer cover closer and reconnect the two plugs. Use an object to wedge the inner door open by a few inches, and lift the front panel such that you can position it and slide it back down on the inner panel as to re-engage the lower holding brackets. This keeps the bottom of the panel in place during the reassembly. Now for the fun part... The upper end of the outer panel has to be positioned just right against the inner panel in order to seat the two long screws that straddle the latch assembly from the inside. You'll need clamps, or two people. There's a flat rubber seal on the top edge of the inner door. See that it is seated properly, and then that it becomes covered by the outer panel. If one person firmly holds the panels precisely in position, then the other person can install the screws to a point of being mildly snug. The other two longer screws go in the top-most holes at the upper/outer corners of the door assembly. Place them next. From there, you can carefully replace all the rest of the screws. Only after all of the screws are in place should you make all of them tight. You're done. Read less"

It was helpful to lubricate the two catches on the lid that snap on the pin with some liquid soap before attempting to snap them on the pin. After the lid is snapped into place and the short legs of the coil spring are in the lip of the lid, use needle nose pliers to attach the other end of the coil spring to the pillar where it was before you removed the old lid.

I have a granite counter top, so no need to remove any screws on the top lip of the dishwasher. I also had a very long water hose, drain hose and electric cord, so I could pull the dishwasher out without disconnecting or turning off anything. All was lef t was to remove the sound insulation from the top (be sure to get it back on like you took it off) and then take the old springs out. They were kinda stuck in there but even if you get some plastic coming with them, there is a slot for the new replacement spring to be hammered back in. Hammer the spring back in (I used a brass hammer) and route the cord back up to the latch for the cord. Make sure you don't get it upside down or you may get a noise when it hits the metal. If there is a sharp bang when the door closes, you need to turn the plastic clip over. Usually only one side will break first and you can use the other side as a guide on how things should fit. Using needle nose pliers, reconnect the plastic end (opposite the spring) back into the steel clip (do this with the door shut). Do the same to the other side and you are finished. Make sure the door operates well with no noise before you slide it back in. The spring kit I got was PN PS8770519 for my Bosch Dishwasher which is 19 years old, I assume that iy came with the house and that's how old the house is. Easy Read less"

To remove the gasket, you actually have to remove your mounting brackets at the top of your dishwasher and then pull the machine out a little bit. You would then slide the left and right sides up from your dishwasher and then pull your gasket off. I hope that helps! Good luck with your repair."

Locate the broken spring. It will be on the floor under the dish washer. Remove the broken spring. Place the new spring end in the hole in the chord end and place the chord over the plastic guide. Use a pliers to stretch the spring and fasten it to the hole in the lower dishwasher frame at the back of the dishwasher. Check the door for proper tension. Replace the lower panel and secure with the two screws. I recommend replacing both springs at the same time to insure proper balance.

Due to the age of the fridge I decided to replace them all, especially the sprIngs. I made sure to watch all of the videos for each part. Although they overlapped, each one showed the repair in more detail. The repair was as shown. If your frosge has been in service like mine for many years, plan on taking thw whole ice chute and dispenser door assembly out for thorough cleaning. One trick I learned is to take pictures as I disassemble so I can refer back for reassembly. When I put it together, the microswitch didn't work. I ordered that part, the only one I missed initially and installed it when it came in. Everything worked well. There was no video for the torsion spring and alignment of the chute and frame is tricky, make sure you take a picture. Part Select should dona video foe that. The putty knife trick for the trim ring was key. It was only shown in one video for an internal part so glad I watched them all. Read less"

The source of the problem looks more like the door latch because I use to push the door in to get it going before I replace the parts. The v ideo I received via email that show the how to do it was very helpful.————-Update after more than month. (12/30/2020)The problem still persists. However I have a possible solution for it that doesn’t require any parts at all. The entire dishwasher is tilted backward. As the washing started and the water pileup in the bottoms of the dishwasher, it pull the entire dishwasher back work causing the switch interlock to release (open the relay causing the door open been sounds). Level the dishwasher so that it doesn’t tilt backwards and this should fix the issue. I will post the latest after a month. If you need more info I can send a picture to describe the issue more clearly.—————————Update 01-06-2021The problem still persists. The above theory I had was wrong and didn’t make any difference. However, I have a permanent solution but it may not be ideal for most people ??. The relay that get close/open when the door is close/open is now always CLOSED. To start the dishwasher just press start and make sure you don’t open the door while the dishwasher is running. It will not stop. I am sorry and I know it’s not a good solution but it’s kind of funny. Read less"

(i've replaced the filter several times and still having the issue)  thanks!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Andy,\nThank you for your question.  If you have air trapped in the water line, you will need to flush the water system to remove it.  Press and hold the water dispenser lever for a few minutes to completely flush the air out. If the water lines are not fitted correctly or if you have just recently replaced the water filter, air may become trapped in the water lines.  When you install a new water filter, it is important to flush the water filter before using it.  Consult your owner's manual for information on the correct procedure for your refrigerator.  If air is not the issue and the dispenser continues to occasionally not dispense water, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check dispenser door solenoid assembly, the water filter head, the electronic control board, the microswitch and the dispenser door assembly and flapper.  We hope this helps!

Next, remove the lower piece of metal bracket from beneath the door by unfastening the two sheet metal screws (a nut driver or a screwdriver will do the job), taking note as to how it comes off so as to facilitate replacement. Some will recommend loosening the screws at the top from beneath the counter and pulling the machine forward a bit to gain access to the sides but, if you have a small enough hand (as I do), you can just reach in there and and hook the spring into place. I didn't want to risk loosening any plumbing! You'll need a flashlight to see where the ends connect. And, if one spring is still intact, you can reference that to reassure yourself you've got it right. I was able to stretch the spring out by hand and hook the thing to that little plastic gadget that pivots when you open the door. That's it! Button her up! You're done! Read less"

I could get the spring on the spindle correctly but could not get the two spring prongs to catch to create spring tension on the door without using a thin knife blade to carefully push each prong to where it caught on the dispenser door. I needed to slide the prongs slowly and carefully to get them to catch on the door. This distorted the spring. That's why you really need two springs. I then used needle nose pliers to pull the latching part of the spring to catch on the inner door. That distorts the spring, too. So you really need two springs.

Remove the pin, first noting the position of the spring. Reassemble the spring on the hinge pin in reverse order. Then snap the lid onto the spring using the two mounting \"posts\". NOTE: I used a very fine needle nose pliers to move the two spring \"legs\" behind the detergent box edge after I had mounted the lid. Flip the lid down to test if the spring pressure on the lid can be felt. Harold Kitzmann, Fishersville VA Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "The soap dispenser sometimes has soap left after washing and dishes are not clean. A few times the door of dispenser is not open. Which parts should I replace? Thanks!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ling, Thank you for your inquiry. If the dispenser is not opening and releasing the soap, then check the parts of the dispenser such as the seal, the spring and the lid. The seal is only available as part of the complete dispenser assembly. It could also be caused by the water not being hot enough so we would recommend checking the water circulation pump with heater and make sure that the water going into the dishwasher is hot. You can test the pump with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. We hope this helps."

Obviously a point of failure. >BUT - after replacement, it still did not solve the problem of the dishes not drying.After much web searching, I tried the diagnostic mode on the dishwasher, and that did a hard reset of the logic board and FIXED the problem.

        "repairInstruction": "Previous self-repair instructions provided on this site were very helpful. I started by removing items from under the sink and inspecting drainage and water hoses of the dishwasher to determine amount of \"play\" for sliding the washer out. Next, remove the two screws that secure the washer under the top of the counter. Then, remove the kickplate and barrier at the bottom. The washer then slid easily out far enough to explose the spring connector arms. I removed the old springs from the floor and the pieces of the old links (one link was ok, but I saved it for a spare). I installed the links and springs on both sides and connected to the first hole. By the way, the hole in the lower frame relatively close behind link is NOT the spring connection hole. There are a series of holes farther back. After testing the door and re-hooking the springs twice,I decided that the fourth hole gave the tension that I wanted. Now the door will come up about half way on its own, but will stay fully open when pulling out the empty bottom basket. Slide the washer back under the counter, being careful not to catch the insulation at the top and sides of the washer. Line up the top screw holes and install the screws. Install the barrier panel and kickplate at the bottom. I had to \"fiddle\" with the kick plate and barrier panel a little to get it right because I did not play close attention when removing them. I probably saved $100 by doing it myself. My wife said \"It's just like new!\" Read less"

They are not always OEM parts and may not work on your model. It could also happen if you only replaced one side. Sometime both sides need to be replaced at the same time. If you only had one side before it could have become wore out. Glad the videos have been able to help you!"

I recently ordered the cap for the dispense to maybe that will help. It seems my dishes are not getting as clean as they should and the soap not all the way breaking down. Do you think ordering the new cap will solve that issue? I have gone without one for month and just started recently having this problem more often.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Marissa,\nThank you for your question.  The lights will blink on your dishwasher if your dishwasher detects an error.  In this case there is a cleaning error.  If the dishwasher is not cleaning the dishes correctly, you will need to check the chopper assembly, the spinner kit, the spray arm seal, the sump pump check valve, the spray arm seal, the impeller and seal kit, the heating element, the water inlet valve and the circulation pump.  Also, the water may not be hot enough to dissolve the soap.  Before running a cycle, turn the hot water on and let it run for a few minutes and then run a cycle and make sure there is good water pressure.  If the dishes are not getting clean, the dishes may be loaded in a way that prevents all of the dishes from being cleaned.  Try arranging them so that the water can reach all of them.  Try varying the amount of soap used as well to see if that helps.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

The whole job was very easy for a person that's never repaired a dishwasher before. I als o found that the return tube gasket at the top of the dishwasher was leaking and repaired that by making a new gasket out of a flat piece of rubber and an o-ring. All leaks have been repaired. With regards to the return tube issue, it may have only been loose and if so, I could have just tightened the return tube outlet and gotten the same results. The people at this site were excellent.

The dish washer door becomes a bit ajar in the middle of the wash cycle and the dish washer shuts off at that moment. When i then push both sides on the top part of the door, the wash restarts and finishes and all is well.

If the unit is shutting off sporadically and pushing on the top parts of the door activates the washer again, the issue is with the door latch and switches.

We cleaned out most of the crud and tried to remove the remaining crud around the flood switch (308), then ran it again this morning. I listened and thought i heard some water running, but when i opened it after the cycle finished, it was still dry, and most or all of the dishwasher liquid residue left from the previous failure to clean was still here. I tried turning the flood switch, and was able to twist is up to about 90 degrees, but it did not come out. Is this likely to be a flood switch problem, and if i need to replace it, how can i get it out? -- thanks, jeff hecht",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jeff, Thank you for your inquiry. The two parts we would recommend checking to solve this issue are the flood switch and water inlet valve. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. To remove the flood switch, You will have to remove the lower rack, remove the lower wash arm, remove the lower coarse filter, removed fine filter, and you may have to remove the filter adaptor as well. Removed two 1/4\" head screws with nut driver to then remove float switch, unplugged float switch, plugged in new switch, and reverse the process. Hope this helps!"

That would be my first go to for what would not be bringing water into your appliance. You should be able to test that valve with a multi meter. Yes you would have to remove the unit to get to the valve and check the flood switch as well. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Trying to avoid getting soaked with a repair bill on my GE profile dishwasher, hoping to get a bit of insight or confirmation that the flood switch is the most likely problem.

Cleaned out the filter at the bottom of the unit, which was quite loaded up with residue, but would still pass water \"pretty well\".  Neither the type of cycle selected, \"power dry\" setting, nor the temp of the input water (by running sink until hot) has any noticeable effect.Thanks for your help!\n\ntodd",

The flood switch can sometimes cause this issue, however most of the time the first part to check is actually the heating element for your appliance. That part tends to be the issue more times than not. You can test that part with a multi meter. The element should be reading between 0 - 50 ohms of resistance to be in working condition.

Also found that the housing was leaking at the shaft that goes to the solenoid and dripping on the solenoid and had rusted the me tal plunger that goes into the solenoid. Bought the housing and solenoid unit. 1 screw (bottom one) on the housing was rusted becaue of the water. Had to hacksaw the housing and then had to drill out that screw. Also, the pump housing screen is left hand thread and is tough to get out. Had to hacksaw that too. Be careful of the orientation of the metal ring in the impeller area. I did that backwards the first time and the motor would not move. Also, the electrical connector to the motor appears to be polarized so it can only go on 1 way-notice before you take it out. Be sure to screw the solenoid bracket back on tight and notice the spring orientation before you remove-the new one was different than the old. Bottom line is that it works fine, and for $40, it's fixed, rather than spending $800 for a new one. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Anell,\nThank you for your question.  When your multi-meter is set the R x 1 setting, place each of the meter's probes on one terminal each. When the probes touch the terminals, the reading should change from a reading of infinity to a reading of approximately 40 ohms. If you receive a reading of infinity, or a reading that is no where near 40 ohms, then you will need to replace the solenoid.  Where the reading is near 40 ohms the drain solenoid and bracket assembly should be fine.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

Originally, the problem was that the dryer wouldn’t heat, so I opened it up, and removed the drum thinking it might be the heating element. It wasn’t, and the ohm reading confirmed this. It turned out to be a burnt wire connector to the element ( unknown to me, and found out later, was that the start swi tch had remained continuously in the down position because the switch was pressed too far down and thus remained locked “on” in place under the surrounding cabinet frame. This, in my opinion, caused for a continual call for heat and thus burnt the wire.)I replaced the burnt wire/connector and reassembled. Now the dryer would heat, but would only run if the start button was continually depressed. Let go of the button, and the dryer stopped. Repair pros suggested a new start switch. I bought a new start switch along with a new interlock switch (it basically shuts off dryer if belt breaks because lack of a belt releases pressure on the pulley that keeps switch depressed.) Apparently they can go bad, too. It turns out neither of these switches were bad. Instead, upon further inspection, after the first installation of the drum belt, the L-shaped bracket which holds the pulley for belt tension became dislocated from its correct position and was not allowing for the depression of the interlock switch, causing the dryer to “read” broken belt, and thus, not run. I loosened the motor bracket to allow placing the bracket in the correct position. Reassembled and all was good. PSA - almost every sheet metal edge is razor sharp. In the process of returning parts.

The motor will not remain running when the start button is released if there are loose wires with the interlock switch. You can also test the switch for continuity if you have a multi-meter, and we would advise to replace it if it is not showing continuity.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Zach, \n\nThank you for your question. Your interlock switch is down by your motor inside of your appliance. When you look at your model diagrams on our site, it is underneath the blower and motor diagram. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Steve,\n\nThank you for the question. I suggest replacing the Interlock Switch,PartSelect Number PS1481922 (different from the door switch). The interlock switch may also be referred to as a belt switch. This part is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the appliance from operating when the door is open.The interlock switch senses the door is shut and the dryer can begin. This part might need to be replaced if your dryer is not starting.\n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mary,\nThank you for your question.  This issue is usually caused by a either an interlock switch or a motor relay.  If you are handy with a multimeter, you can test the parts to see which one is causing the issue.   I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dale,\nThank you for your inquiry.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the interlock switch, the drive belt, the door switch, the door latch, the idler pulley wheel, the door strike, the slides, inlet control thermostat, the igniter, and the rear drum bearing.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Hi, I am not able to turn the power on for my GE dryer. My husband did remove the plastic exterior push button and I can start the dryer by pushing interior black dome shaped button on with a screwdriver, however I would like to get a replacement part to actually fix the machine. I am just not sure exactly which part is required? I have had the dryer for between 5-7 years.  I love GE products and have always used them, however I am a little bit disappointed this time with the washer and dryer I have as both of them are not that old and have required repair already and now again. The first two times on the washer required a service call with repairmen. Thanks for your help and quick response. Sincerely, Janet a. Gross, loyal GE customer",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Janet,\n\nThank you for contacting Part Select. The start button you need to replace is only sold as part of the Control Panel Assembly - White. Part number PS3487098. The start button is part of the panel and should not be removed so it is not sold as a separate part. \n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello George,\n\nThanks for your question. The humming and lack of starting may indicate that the door switch, part number PS2344321, is at fault. I would recommend testing the door switch for continuity with a multi-meter, and if it does not test for continuity, replace it.\n\nI hope this helps."

Actuating door switch makes a clicking sound on the control board (as if it's trying to stop the motor, but the motor is not running).  Continuity check on door switch, high limit thermostat, and belt switch all seem ok.  Motor and drum spin freely (by hand) and belt is in good shape.  Any ideas what to check next?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Steve, \n\nThank you for your question. I could probably suggest just taking a quick look at all of your thermostats and your thermal fuses. You should have at least two of each on your appliance from what I am seeing. two on the blower housing and then two on the heating element. If all of your parts there are fine, you  may have to look into your motor being the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello John,\n\nThanks for your question. There are a few different parts you will want to test with a multimeter to see if they have continuity. Replace them if they show no continuity. Test the interlock switch and the door latch. You may then want to test the motor and pump out to see if they are working properly.\n\nI hope this helps."

If it goes bad, it is possible that the dishwasher may flood or leak. You may want to test it with a multi-meter to see if it has continuity and replace it if it does not show continuity.

It also helps the drain pump know when the water has been all drained out of the machine. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Mario,\n\nThanks for your question. This will vary from model to model for the exact parts, but you will want to check the water inlet valve with a multi-meter for continuity, replacing it if it shows no continuity. Check the wash arm impeller inside the pump and motor, as well as considering the idea that the pump may be bad. Examine the spray arms to see if any of them are clogged and clean them if needed. Test the float switch as well with a multi-meter for continuity and replace it if it does not show continuity.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "customerQuestion": "DISHWASHER - MAYTAG MODEL MDBH979SAM0\nType 577-1\nHi - we had water leaking, and at first it seemed to be the water inlet valve, and we replaced that. New part seems good, no more leaks detected there. Then I noticed a drip from the water inlet hose, and replaced that. No more leaks there. However, water was still (or now) pouring through the bottom of the front door (machine was out from its usual place under cabinet, on tile floor), and at that point I suspected the door gasket, and replaced that. However, issue was not fixed, so we then replaced the front door lower seal as the old one had some hard water build up I couldn't remove (PS11755651), and we also took out the lower (and upper) wash arm parts, cleaned those, and cleaned the upper portion of the sump pump (accumulator and filter, and top of sump pump) of gudge. And, then did our best to LEVEL the machine, which stopped the gush of water, but there is still water filling up in and then draining out of the metal tray at the bottom of the door, (above the white padded material) and coming past the door's lower seal.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Heather, thank you for the question. Since you have replaced and cleaned the most common parts that can cause leaking, we would recommend checking the float switch, part number PS11750031. It shuts the water fill valve off if the water level gets too high before the timed fill cycle ends. We hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Wayne,\n\nThanks for your question. You may wish to check the circulation pump and motor.

Thank you in advance for your help.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Gustavo,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishes are not getting cleaned because there is no water entering the dishwasher and you are hearing a humming sound, it sounds like the issue is with the water inlet valve.  A component in the water inlet valve may have failed and it will need to be replaced.  The water inlet valve is usually located behind the lower access panel. Remove the lower access panel in order to locate the inlet valve.  Once you have located it, visually inspect the water inlet valve for any signs of cracking, wear, or other damage.  If any issues are found during your inspection, you will need a replacement water inlet valve.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "The water will not come in through the jets.",

The water jets on the spray arm are angled, so the water sprays out at an angle, usually about 45 degrees off the vertical. The water inlet valve PS16218688 allows the water to flow in from the house water supply. You should check both the house and the Inlet valve as well as any kinks in an inlet hose. We hope this helps."

Continuity is good on heating element and high limit thermostat. I replaced fuse but did not help. Thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Paul, Thank you for the question. We suggest testing the Door Switch. If defective it will not allow the Wash Cycle to start.  Use your ohmmeter to test your switch for continuity. Begin by setting your ohmmeter to measure resistance at a scale of Rx1. Touch the metal tips of the test leads together and zero your ohmmeter by adjusting the thumbwheel in the front of the meter until the needle reads '0' on the scale. Touch one meter lead to the COM terminal and the other lead to the N.O. terminal. Do not push in on the actuator. Your meter should give a reading of infinity, meaning the circuit is open, and there is no continuity. Without moving the meter's leads, press down on the actuator until you hear a 'click'. With the 'click' of the actuator, the meter should produce a resistance reading of zero ohms. This means the circuit is closed and continuity is present.Keep the meter lead that is touching the COM terminal in place, but move the other meter lead from the N.O. terminal to the N.C. terminal. You should receive a reading of infinity when you push in on the switch's actuator. When the actuator is released, you should receive a resistance reading of zero ohms.\n\nNow, set your ohmmeter to its highest resistance scale and touch one meter lead to the N.O. terminal and the other meter lead to the N.C. terminal. The resistance reading between these two leads should be infinite.\n\nFinally, take a resistance reading from both the N.C. terminal and the N.O. terminal to any metal mounting hardware that is a part of the switch assembly. You should receive a normal reading of infinity. We hope this helps!"

To begin this repair, unplug your dishwasher or disconnect the power. You will want to remove the screws that are holding the inner door to remove the inner door panel. You will see wires leading to the old latch assembly, remove them and the assembly. Using the same steps but backwards you can connect the new assembly, put it back in place, and reattach the inner door panel. Good luck with this repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi David, great question. You are right, the only way to open a jammed door would be to lift the door and with controlled movements to jerk it outwards. Before attempting this, we recommend checking the dishwasher to make sure it is properly mounted so that the jerking movement does not slide it out of place and hurt the dishwasher. Otherwise, by doing this you will not be at risk for breaking anything. Just be careful and give yourself some space. I hope this helps."

You will have to remove all of the screws holding the inner door panel to the outer door panel. You should then be able to pop off your old latch. If the wire harness is hard to remove from your latch you can use a flat head screw driver to help push the plugs off of the old terminals. Make sure to replace your handle as this part does not come with your handle already attached. After you have done that, just follow these steps in reverse to put your appliance back together. I hope that helps!"

I did order an extra spring because like one reviewe r noted, having a spring on only one side of the latch is a design flaw, and the reason for the broken latch in the first place. My only problem came on reassembly. I should have taken a photo or two BEFORE taken everything apart. After several trials and errors it went quickly back together AND it worked perfectly. Read less"

The source of the problem looks more like the door latch because I use to push the door in to get it going before I replace the parts. The v ideo I received via email that show the how to do it was very helpful.————-Update after more than month. (12/30/2020)The problem still persists. However I have a possible solution for it that doesn’t require any parts at all. The entire dishwasher is tilted backward. As the washing started and the water pileup in the bottoms of the dishwasher, it pull the entire dishwasher back work causing the switch interlock to release (open the relay causing the door open been sounds). Level the dishwasher so that it doesn’t tilt backwards and this should fix the issue. I will post the latest after a month. If you need more info I can send a picture to describe the issue more clearly.—————————Update 01-06-2021The problem still persists. The above theory I had was wrong and didn’t make any difference. However, I have a permanent solution but it may not be ideal for most people ??. The relay that get close/open when the door is close/open is now always CLOSED. To start the dishwasher just press start and make sure you don’t open the door while the dishwasher is running. It will not stop.

To access that area you should open the door and unscrew the mounting plates from the counter top and pull the dishwasher out of its space a bit to access the latch area.

        "customerQuestion": "In my Maytag dishwasher (above model number) the black coloured plastic latch (or handle) that I used to grab to open the door of the dishwasher has broken off. I can still open the door by inserting my hand into the front cavity. I am confused from looking at the diagram in the PartSelect website whether to order a handle or door latch?  Also do I need a connector.  Thank you!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Kersi,\nThank you for your question. The handle for your dishwasher can be purchased separately.  The part number listed under your model number for the handle is PS11752989. You should not need a connector.  To install the part, first make sure that the dishwasher has been either unplugged from the electrical outlet or that the circuit breaker has been turned off.  Unscrew the inside door panel using a star screw driver. Unscrew the broken plastic handle and replace it with the new handle. Once the door has been put back together, restore the power to the dishwasher. Everything should now work for you. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "I'm not sure which part to order.  When you open the dishwasher, the entire plastic top panel lifts out of place.  Is this called the \"handle\"?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Diann,\nThank you for your question.  If the panel you are referring to is the control panel then you will either need to refasten it to the door or order a new one if it is damaged.  There are 3 control panels listed under your model number.  The part number listed under your model number for the black control panel is PS11723016.  The part number listed for the white control panel is PS11723017.  The part number listed for the stainless steel control panel is PS11723019. If it is the handle itself that is coming apart from the door, then you will need to refasten it to the door or replace it if it is damaged. \nIf you need to place an order for one of these parts, you may order it either online or by calling our customer service line and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Brad, Thank you for the question. The drain hose may not have a loop in it. The fill water may be draining out of the dishwasher by going straight out the drain hose. Be sure that your drain hose is not simply laying straight. It must have a loop in it or be off the ground so the water is not gravity fed out via the drain hose. You can also try to empty the dishwasher, set it to run a wash cycle. Let it fill with water as normal. When the dishwasher begins the cycle, open the door and see if the water level is just under the heating elements.If there is not enough water there may be a clog in your water fill line. Remove the fill hose where it attaches to the fill valve. Check to be sure there is nothing clogging the screen on the inlet fill valve. Also check the water fill line for blockage. You can also check the Overfill Control Switch if it is not filling with water at the correct level. If it is defective it can shut the water flow off too soon. Hope this helps!"

You can try running the hot water in the adjoining sink to get the hot water up to max temperature before starting the dishwasher. If this does not help try opening the door a bit during the wash cycle to see if there is steam indicating the water is hot. If the water is not getting hot then you may need to replace the heating element. \n\nHope this helps!"

Since the high limit thermostat will shut down the heating element once it reaches a certain temperature, it could be causing the issue. You can test it with a multimeter to see if it has continuity.

The electronic control board is PS8260225 - this is rarely the issue, but it could be worth cutting off power to the dishwasher for one minute and then restarting it to see if that fixes the issue before replacing the board. The heating element should read between 8 and 30 ohms so that is testing properly. High limit thermostats are open at room temperature.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Carmelo,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher will not start, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  You will need to check the door balance link kit, the turbidity sensor, the door latch, the overfill control switch and the thermostat. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello, Thank you for your question. The parts that solve that issue is the Element and the thermostat. If the element is new and working properly it could be Thermostat- PartSelect Number PS11750035. We hope this helps."

        "customerQuestion": "My dishwasher quit during the dry cycle.  I opened it and it was very hot and steamy, pressed start and it completed the cycle.  This was after previously having problems and checking the heater which measured 16 ohms, and replacing the thermostat.  After replacing the thermostat, i ran it through a diagnostic cycle which it completed fine, then ran it through a normal wash cycle with prodry selected (empty) and it completed fine.  So we loaded it with dishes and ran a normal was cycle with prodry and it stopped during the cycle.  Could the heater have a sporadic problem?  Should i replace it even though it measures as good, or, is there another more likely part to check/replace?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jim, thank you for your question. If your heater is measuring working then you would not need to change it. I would suggest taking a look at the turbidity sensor perhaps. However the problem might actually be in your control board itself if it is not in the smaller parts like the thermostat and the sensor. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "My dishes aren't drying properly. I replaced the heating element and the thermostat. Is there something I'm missing? What should I try next?\nThanks,\nPete",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Pete,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher is not drying the dishes and you have replaced the heating element and the thermostat, check the rinse aid on the detergent dispenser.  The rinse aid or the rinse aid dispensing door could be the reason why your dishwasher is not fully drying your dishes.  Without the rinse aid, the dishes will not shed water easily and they will not dry properly.  Your rinse aid dispenser will be found on the inside of the door, open the rinse aide door on the dispenser.   After verifying that there is rinse aid in the chamber, inspect the door and chamber for any signs of discoloration, warping, or any other damage.  If you find any issues with your rinse aid dispenser door while performing this inspection, you will need to replace the detergent dispenser.  The part number listed under your model number for the detergent dispenser is PS11731570.  If you need to place an order for it, customer service is open 7 days a week and anyone will be happy to assist you.  Please feel free to give us a call.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

Water gets hot, everything else seems to work.  Thanks for any advice.",

If it completes that, it begins blinking during the dry cycle.I assume the problem is with the heater or the thermostat.  is there a way to determine which without removing the parts and testing? are there any other parts that could be at fault?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jim, Thank you for the question. Unfortunately the only way to know for sure if they are defective is to remove and test them. If the element and thermostat is good, you may need to replace the main control board. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"
      },
      {
        "customerQuestion": "Following up on my prior question - i measured the resistance of the heating element - it was 12 ohms which seems to be an acceptable range from the other messages.  I then measured the resistance of the thermostat (assuming it is the part on the spring bracket near the front of the dishwasher near the water inlet) and it was zero at room temperature.  You'd commented previously that this connection was normally open at room temperature, so, is it good or bad?  If bad - can you tell me how to remove it?If good do you have other suggestions of what i can check to find out what is wrong with our dishwasher?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jim, Thank you for the question. If there is no reading at all then it sounds like it can be defective. The thermostat just plugs into place.  Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

Second failure was the heating element, I ordered the part; At the same time I found a random youtube video, that had me check the continuity of the heater and tested good. Then the video indicated the heater relay may have one leg that has lost the solder and stops the heater element from working. I took the control panel a part and the heater relay had the same failure, one leg had a missing solder joint. Using some flux, solder and soldering iron I repaired the connection and added some addition solder to the circuit. Reassembled and the dishwasher is heating as it was before everything is working as expected! (P.S. The heater relay failure appears to be a common problem, but the actual root cause [relay failure due to poor solder joint] is never reported back to the company, they just hear the heater element stopped working and they never fix the real issue because the customers are throwing out the dishwasher, when it could have been repaired with a simple fix. More importantly it should be something that is investigated as it may needs an engineering redesign. but can't fix what you don't know about or fail to investigate. I did purchase a new relay to replace the existing one, to be installed upon arrival). Once again a random youtube video identifies and resolves a problem, that would have had me purchasing a new dishwasher, and maybe this is all planned engineering obsolescence.

We do not ship overseas. \nOne option is to get in touch with a friend or family member in the US or Canada if you have any people here, another would be to use a freight forwarder in the US or Canada, to whom we can ship the part and who would then forward the part to you. You would need to make these arrangements accordingly. We are sorry for any inconvenience."

If your dishwasher is not draining, I would check the drain pump, the drain hose, and the water inlet valve. If there are no leaks or clogs in the drain hose, test the pump and valve with a multimeter to see if they have continuity. Hope this helps!"

Using a multi-meter set to the lowest resistance I tested both ends of the heating element (OF COURSE I SHUT OFF ELECTRICITY TO THE DISHWASHER FIR ST!!!) and found it read a steady 16 ohms. Then I followed the orange leads to the limiter, removed the leads and tested resistance and found it at near zero. Touchdown.I ordered the new limiter, had it in a couple of days and installed in in 5 minutes. The hardest part was putting the metal cover back on the bottom of the unit.t Read less"

I think they l ead you on with the little parts and you work your way up with the big ones expense wise at this point I will simply cut my losses and buy a new dishwasher because I'm almost at what it would cost for a new one and I've had this one for 4 years. When I went to look for what the problem was each one of these said not cleaning properly which I think now is a generic term to just go from the smallest to the largest if I'm going to replace the motor for 300 plus dollars I might as well just buy a new washer Read less"

Also, the sump assembly looks like a real chore to replace. Thanks, Joe",

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dan,\nThank you for your question.  To test the motor with a multimeter, disconnect the motor's two wire leads from the wiring harness. Set your multimeter to the R x 1 setting. Touch each of the meter's probes to one terminal each. Your motor should show little resistance (a reading of zero, or close to zero).  Now check the ground connection. Place one probe on the bare metal housing of the motor. Place the other probe on each terminal, one at a time. You should not receive any reading on your meter from this test. If your dishwasher's motor fails either of these tests, you will have to replace it.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

I   have levelled   the dishwasher and   am using the correct detergent  there are no soap suds in the dishwasher   and i am still getting the bE error code,  could it be the diverter motor causing the bE  code please help??",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Agotino, thank you for reaching out. The bE error code is triggered by improper detergent use or a dishwasher that is not level. Using the wrong detergent leads to excess sudsing, causing parts like the vent to become filled with soap foam. A dishwasher that is not level will do the same, causing water to flow to parts where it does not belong, potentially damaging components. To fix the issue adjust leveling feet as necessary. To remove detergent residue in the tub pour approximately three to seven ounces of milk into a shallow bowl and place it in the upper rack and run the dishwasher on the Auto cycle. We hope this solves your problem!"

If the dishwasher fills and drains but it will not wash, it means your circulation pump has failed or something is jammed inside the pump impeller, preventing it from turning. You are going to need to uninstall the dishwasher and remove the pump to check for debris. If you find nothing, then replace the motor and pump assembly, part number PS12712308, itself. Good luck with this repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ed,\nThank you for your question.  If the arms do not turn when the dishwasher is in use, you may have a clogged filter or pump or you may have a malfunctioning float switch.  There may also be a blockage in the spray arms or the water pressure is not sufficient enough to turn the arms. You will need to inspect these parts to see which one is causing the issue.  Once you have determined the part you need, please feel free to call customer service.  We are open 7 days a week and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

You can first check the spray arms for any debris in holes. The motor drives an impeller to force water up through the wash arms. If spray arms are clear of debris then you may need to replace the pump and motor assembly, part number PS12712308. We hope this helps."

It is definitly on its last leg, but the last load I did, the dishes were still clean. Could this be the pump/motor?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Trisha, thank you for getting in touch. First, you may need to make sure the dishes are placed properly in the racks and nothing is coming in contact with the spray arms. If that is not causing the issue, then you may need to check the motor and pump assembly, part number PS12712308, as it is most likely faulty. We hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Morgan, thank you for reaching out. According to our research on your model, the problem appears to be with the Lower Spray Arm, part number PS12585623. We also recommend cleaning the dishwasher filter and the soap dispenser before use. Customer service is available 7 days a week if you need help placing an order. We hope this helps!"

The lower, front, kick-plate panel was already off because I had removed it to figure out what was so loud. The steps after that were:- Unplugged it and the disposal under the sink (just in case)- Pulled the wires out of the bottom front of the drai n pump- With a Philips screw driver I loosened the front hose clamp and pulled off the hose- With the pliers I pinched the back hose clamp and pulled off the hose- Twisted the pump off of its soft plastic bracketTo put the new one on I reversed the process.Once it was in place and before I put the panel back on, I plugged in the dishwasher and started a cycle. The pump was quiet but the person who installed the dishwasher in the first place had the drain hose resting on a spring. When the pump ran it resonated through the spring making a pretty loud noise. So I unplugged it again, disconnected the hose, fed it under the spring along the floor and then reconnected it. When I plugged it back in and tested it, things were much quieter.With everything in place I put the panel back on and was finished.Note: I have worked on dishwashers before and most of the time they have insulation behind the kick-plate panel to quiet them, but this one didn’t. I will probably add that some time later. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Scott, thank you for your question. If your dishwasher runs for only a few seconds, you should check the water inlet valve. If the dishwasher cannot fill with water, it will just shut off instead of move onto the next cycle. To test your water inlet valve, set your multimeter to the ohms resistance scale X 1. Place each of the meter's probes to one terminal. Because the reading can vary from brand to brand and from model to model, there is no one reading you should receive. However, if your test produces a reading of infinity, then the solenoid is bad and the water valve should be replaced. Part number PS12578165.  You can test the drain pump in the same way. A good drain pump motor will give 30 to 40ohms of resistance. If it has more or less, then it’s bad. Part number PS11765780. We hope this helps!"

This is the f ront of the pump and access to the filter. Place a large bucket under this cap and slowly loosen the cap. All of the water remaining in the machine will begin to drain (this could be a lot of water. Do not remove the cap completely so that you can quickly stop the flow of water if needed). Once all water is drained from the appliance, Disconnect the two hoses from the pump using a pair of pliers to looses the presure clamps, sliding the clamps back an then pulling off the hoses (be careful of any remaining water in the hoses). Then remove the two screws from the rear base of the pump that secure it to the bottom floor panel of the washer. Slide the pump slightly to the rear to free it from the fittings on the front wall of the machine and the lift the pump up. At this point, firmly pull out the wiring harness plugged into the top right side of the pump. Install the new pump by plugging in the wiring harness and resecuring the pump.

        "customerQuestion": "Washer is smoking during spin operation,and i am finding plastic pc's in the drain pump clean out was wondering 8f plastic pc's could be coming off the inside of the pump everything is working but something is smoking",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Gerald,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If your washer is smoking during the spin cycle there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the belt, the motor pulley, the drain pump, the direct drive motor coupling, the clutch assembly and the drive motor.  Also if you have plastic pieces showing up in your pump it is likely that the drum bearing is worn out or the support for the basket is worn out causing the spin basket to wobble and rub into the front half of the outer tub and you will need to check this out.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Hi, during the rinse cycle there is an unusual noise originating from the base of the machine. I opened the drain pump and removed some water but no objects came out. On one occasion i pressed the pump access door and the noise subsided. Could it be the drain pump that needs replacing?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Satish, Thank you for your inquiry. Possibly, but I would also check the pump access shroud, pump service channel, pump access door and service panel that they attach to in order make sure those parts are not loose as if they were, they could be vibrating during the rinse cycle and causing the noise. You can test the motor and drain pump with a multimeter to see if it is functioning properly. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you.

When it stopped, I went over to take out the laundry. There was strong rubbery smell, and smoke came out of the top of door as soon as I opened it. Checked drive belt on the back, it was fine. Please advise what was wrong with the washer? I like the matching w&d set and would like to repair it if possible. Thank you!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Louisa, thank you for the question. Based on our understanding of the issue, we would suggest you check the drive motor, part number PS1020369. Adding too many clothes to your washing machine can stress the motor, causing it to overheat or malfunction and emit a burning smell. Also, the drive motor bearings might be worn out, resulting in a loud noise during operation. If this part is faulty, you may need to replace it. We hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Carmen,\nThank you for your question.  Here is some information that a customer has left on our website on how he installed the part, \"First removed dishwaser from under counter so I could get to rubber connecter. It is located in center under dishwasher. I first needed to unscrew with wrench rubber connection at pump and and then the complete piece unscewed by hand from pump wash arm. I then just had to screw new rubber connector back on to bottom of dishwasher and re-attached at the pump. It was very easy to replace the rubber connector. I also replaced the dishwasher sump housing because it was made of same rubbber material and feared it was deteriorating also. I had to unscrew with wrench at pump as well and it just popped out from inside dishwasher after unscrewing screen inside dishwaser. Popped new piece in and screwed screen back on and reconnected underneath dishwasher back to pump. The rack roller wheel just popped right on. FYI: The wheel is actually 1.75 inches in diameter not 2 inches. I was worried it might be too big if it where 2 inches but it was the same size as the other wheels which was 1.75 inches. The hardest part of this job was getting the dishwasher in and out from under the counter. The good news is that most of these parts are standard and the replacement parts fit perfect.\"  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Thank you for the answer to my original question.  Now i have more information to give you.  I removed the sump cover and sump strainer cap.  The water is staying in the sump housing.  We checked the hose to the disposal and cleared some build up.  We ran the dishwasher with the hose removed and the water drained but stayed in the sump housing when the cycle completed.  Your reply was to check the drain basket, where is that? With this additional information, can you suggest anything?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Karen,\nThank you for getting back to us.  The drainage basket or drain screen is inside the interior bottom below the rotating washer arm.  You will need to pull the lower dishrack forward to locate the drain basket.  You will need to twist the basket one-half turn to the left and lift the part out of the appliance. I hope this helps with the repair.  Have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Karen,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The water is supposed to completely drain out once a dishwashing cycle is completed.  If there is water pooling at the bottom of your dishwasher it could be that food or debris is blocking the drain drain basket or the drain hose and you need to clean them out.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Tim, thank you for your question. Once the reservoir is filled, a pump sprays water and soap all over the dishes. At the end of the cycle, the pump will discharge water out of the drain. Our suggestion is to replace the Timer PS959249. The purpose of a dishwasher timer is to control the unit's cycles by regulating the length of time that power is directed to each component. We are pleased to have been able to help."

        "repairInstruction": "10 year old stainless steel faced Frigidaire dishwasher. The motor assembly part fixed my problem. This was the second part required to fix the dishwasher. A week prior I replaced the inlet water solenoid switch to correct the \"no water filling issue\". I think that the main motor assembly pump ran dry and caused it to fail, so it is criti cal NEVER to run this part dry. The repair was relatively easy, I will say it would be great to have some instructions with the parts, however the kit came with everything. you essentially slide the dishwasher out disconnecting power and water ( i left the discharge connected since the service loop was long). you disconnect all the main pump electrical and water connections, labeling made it easy. you take the motor assembly out thru the inside tub. Once the internal sump assembly is out you can clean the sump and remove the old pump. Pull it out straight and dont wiggle it. The kit comes with new O rings that i put a light smear of vaseline on for a good seal. You reinstall the sump and make connections. Since my dishwasher is old, the original Molex power connector to the motor is different on the new motor. The kit comes with a new style connector, what you have to do is snip off your old connector and the kit comes with a new connector with crimps on the ends, you slide the provided heat shrink over each wire and then crimp your dishwashers wires to the new connector. I then used a butane lighter to shrink the heat shrink. The heat shrink is not absolutely necessary since the crimps are insulated, but since the kit came with two perfectly cut pieces of heat shrink I felt obligated to use it. This sounds all complicated but it really wasn't and much cheaper than a new dishwasher! Interestingly and this only maybe in my case but the dishwasher seems to clean better than it ever did.. for now we are not pre-rinsing! Read less"

When parts arrived I removed door in order to get at the bottom door gasket, replace it, and removed the tube gasket and replaced it with new parts. The whole job was very easy for a person that's never repaired a dishwasher before. I als o found that the return tube gasket at the top of the dishwasher was leaking and repaired that by making a new gasket out of a flat piece of rubber and an o-ring. All leaks have been repaired. With regards to the return tube issue, it may have only been loose and if so, I could have just tightened the return tube outlet and gotten the same results. The people at this site were excellent.

        "customerQuestion": "I have a Maytag 665.15114 dw. Apparently the wdt710paym4 Whirlpool is the same unit.  Neither spray arms work. I've cleaned them both. I've replaced the water control valve and circulation pump. It drains fine. To test water level i added a couple quarts of additional water after the filling process. I hear a series of clicks from the control panel. It appears to run through the cycles but never spray the water. Help please.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Dan, Thank you for your inquiry. I would check both of your spray arms to make sure they are not clogged. We would also check your impeller motor and pump assembly to make sure it is working properly to force the water up through the wash arms. You can also test the Turbidity Sensor with a multimeter to make sure it is functioning as well. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Matt,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The drain pump is the part that fixes the issue the majority of the time.  There are some parts that you may need to check as well to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the drain hose, the filter, the turbidity sensor and the heating element.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jake, you have replaced all the suggested parts that we can recommend to fix the washer not draining, it is definitely possible it is the control board, but there is no way to tell for sure. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair!"

It waits the appropriate time and then drains and continues.  What it doesn't do is spray water through the arms or dispense the detergent.   I checked that the arms aren't clogged, checked that the float moves freely, checked whether the inlet valve was clogged, ran a quart of vinegar through it which visibly cleaned some fat out of the drain hose, and checked the door switch with a multimeter and it is fine.  This looks like an easy job and i can actually reach it from the front of the machine, but should i be looking at anything else first? Thanks!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Karen,\nThank you for your question. After doing the checks with the spray arms and door switch, yes we would also suggest replacing the turbidity sensor under part PS11757214 for your model to fix the issues, as there aren't any other parts other then the control board as a last case scenario that would fix the issues.

        "customerQuestion": "The water is leaking from part 71.  How do you get it out and put it back?  There is an electric wire attached to the bottom of the red stopper thing.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Era,\nThank you for your question.  Before you begin any repair please unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet and turn off the dishwasher's water supply.  The turbidity sensor is mounted on the sump and tells the control board how dirty the water is so it can adjust the cycles.  You will need to pull the dishwasher out to do the repair.  You will need to disconnect the lines.  First you will need to remove the dishwasher drain line.  Have towel handy in case any water comes out.  You will also need to remove the fill line attached to the hot water tap.  Once you have this done, you can open the dishwasher door and take the bottom rack out.  Then remove the screws that the dishwasher to the countertop.  Once the screws are removed, You can pull the dishwasher out of the cabinet and lay it down on its back.  Be sure to lay a blanket or towel down before you lay it down in case any water comes out of the dishwasher.  Once the dishwasher is on it's back, you will now have access to the bottom of the dishwasher and the turbidity sensor.  It is mounted on the sump just under the drain pump.  Remove the wiring harness attached to the sensor by pressing on the locking tab to release it.  To get the sensor out of the sump you will need to turn it counter-clockwise and then pull it out.  To install the new sensor and reinstall the dishwasher under the counter follow the steps in reverse and once the dishwasher has been reinstalled turn the water back on and plug the power back in and the dishwasher should work now for you.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

So I have removed the drain motor pump and check it with a multimeter and value was moving all the time with high and low value, so I have replaced it by a new one and test it before installing it and every thing was fine (a fix value around 240ohm). I tryed a new cycle and the problem is still there the dishwasher doesnt want to drain. Do you think it could come  from the turbidity sensor, or any other piece ?\nThank you for your help",

As the soil level increases, the amount of transmitted light decreases. The turbidity sensor measures the amount of transmitted light to determine the turbidity of the wash water. These turbidity measurements are supplied to the dishwasher controller, which makes decisions on how long to wash in all the cycles.The E17 code is indicating the unit is getting too much water into the tub. We would recommend testing or replacing the float switch and water valve first. I hope this helps!"

Your leakage protection system has activated. Check to make sure the water inlet hose and sump seal are not damaged or worn-out and are leading to water leakage. If this does not solve the issue, we would recommend checking the float switch assembly, part number PS8737139. Float switch assembly shuts the water fill valve off if the water level gets too high before the timed fill cycle ends. Good luck with the repair!"

The dishwasher is expecting 110 degree water to enter your dishwasher, so if your pipes are cold, the water may only come in luke warm.  To correct this issue, just run your faucet next to the dishwasher until the water coming out is hot. Hope this helps!"

Using a screwdriver, un-thread the mounting screws securing the panels at the bottom front.\n2. Remove both panels and set them aside.\n3. Un-thread the screws securing the terminal box cover.\n4. Un-thread the water supply line from the water supply valve\n5. Disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain.\n6. Open the dishwasher door and remove the mounting screws.\n7. Un-thread the screws securing the thermistor to the sump.\n8. Pull the thermistor out.\nWe hope this information helps!"

These turbidity measurements are supplied to the dishwasher controller, which makes decisions on how long to wash in all the cycles. If faulty or dirty, it will effect the cycle length.

The first thing i checked was the drain filter which was clogged. I took shop vac and sucked all the excess water out and removed the flood switch. seemed ok but you can't tell if its ok, so just r eplace it. I then removed the door from the unit. I needed to replace the dispenser. After the door was off I tilted the machine forward, to check the heater. I pulled the quick connects off and checked the resistance across the heater, should be 16 ohms mine was 16.3 so heater not bad. looking at the bottom of the machine, follow the left hand wire and it will attach to a thermal overload. (a small round disc which is not listed in the parts manuals ), I checked for continuity across the switch it was open. On this model GE the switch is resettable, a small reset button in the middle of the overload. I reset it and continuity was restored. only three things might cause this to kick. one the flood switch, the vent fan or the turbidity sensor. I replaced all three and the machine is working great. If you have replaced your heater and still doesn't heat, try resetting that switch. and give GE a big thank you for not telling any one about the switch.

We cant remember the last time it worked properly. Dishwasher leaves a soap film on front door and does not dry dishes. I assume i need a thermostat, but can not find it for this model.Please help.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Matthew, thank you for your question. There would be a few things to check before ordering any parts. I would check to make sure the heating element received is working properly, by checking continuity. Depending upon the manufacturer, the element should read 15 to 25 ohms of resistance. If it reads \"0\", then it's bad. It is possible the part was defective. If the part is testing good, I would check to see what the temperature of the water is that is coming from the house to the unit. The temperature might need to be adjusted. Also, it is recommended that you \"prime\" the unit by running the water at the sink in your kitchen until the water is hot. Then turn on the dishwasher. If the water source takes a while to heat, the water going into the unit might not be hot enough for the element to keep hot. I hope this helps!"

That is why we ordered the heating element to replace. 2. How do i adjust the temp coming into the dishwasher? Thank you",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Matthew, Thank you for your inquiry. Water entering the dishwasher must be at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit and not more than 150 degrees Fahrenheit for the best cleaning/drying and to prevent damage to the dishes. You have to adjust the temperature at the point where the fill hoses are attached to the sink or where the water enters and goes into the water inlet valve-check your water heater as well. Also make sure you are using plenty of rinse aid to assist in drying. If the element tests ok with a multimeter, you may have an issue with your control board as well. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "My dishwasher drains the water but at the end of the cycle there is still an abnormal amount of water in the bottom. I’ve already replaced the level sensor and water inlet valve because of other problems.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Brandon,\nThank you for your question.  It is normal at the end of a cycle to have 1 or 2 cups of water left in the bottom of the dishwasher.  If there is more than 1 or 2 cups of water left in the dishwasher, there may be debris trapped in the pump preventing the water from draining completely.  You will need to inspect the pump to see if this is what is causing the issue and clean it if it is.  If the pump is not the issue, you may have to replace the flood switch.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

With the power supply to the dishwasher turned off, the turbidity sensor can be tested from the main control at the connection P12 from the wire at pin 1 to the wire at pin 3. The resistance should measure between 46KO to 52KO at room temperature. We hope this helps."

The temperatures do not really make sense to me as my dishes look clean even after drying (with air/open dishwasher). My issue is once the dishwasher stops running, I open the door and it is not hot in the washer which makes me think the element is not heating. Can you point me to if I need to change the control board if it turns out my element is good? You do not think it is the thermostat? I want to be mindful of my cost in parts to justify not purchasing a new washer.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Matthew,\n\nThanks for your question. It is also possible the vent might not be opening properly. Check to see if it is opening or if the vent is damaged. If that is not the issue, then it could be an issue with your dispenser. First, make sure the rinse aid chamber is not empty. If there is rinse aid in the chamber, then inspect the cap to make sure it is properly fitted and adjusted properly.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "customerQuestion": "I’m having problems with my dishwasher not heating during the drying phase and the soap is not rinsing off the dishes. I’ve already replaced the heating element and i’m not sure if it is draining like it should. There is still some water remaining when i unscrew the filter. About two weeks ago there was a grinding noise like something we put in the dishwasher may have broke and got caught in the grinder. There were some small black plastic pieces in the filter and they have all been removed. I’m trying to figure out what to check and what parts i need.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Joe,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher is not cleaning properly, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the spray arms, the docking station (if present), the upper discharge housing gasket (if present), the chopper, the water inlet valve, the water delivery tube, the filters, the wash spinner, the detergent spinner, the pump impellers and the pump.  All dishwashers will have a method to drain the water. Most models will have a single motor driven pump with two separate compartments, one for circulation and one for drain, each with its own impeller. Other types will have a separate drain pump and some will utilize the main circulating pump in conjunction with a drain solenoid and diverter valve or flapper. On models that use a separate drain pump you should check to see if there is any obstruction to the input and output of the pump and also verify that there is power getting to the pump motor during the drain portion of the cycle. If both check ok, then you should replace the pump and motor assembly.\n\nOn models that use a drain flapper and solenoid, again you should check for any obstructions and verify that the solenoid is getting energized and that there is continuity. Use a multi-meter to make these tests. Check that the linkage operating the flapper or diverter is moving freely and replace any defective parts. On models that have a two section pump, the drain impeller may be at fault. First, verify that the motor is running in the proper direction. If the motor does not run, then check for power at the terminals on the motor. If voltage is not present, then you should check door switches, timer or electronic control as a possible cause. If proper voltage is present, then the motor windings could be open. If the motor is humming, then the problem could be that the drain impeller is jammed or the motor could be seized. If the motor is seized, then the motor or motor and pump assembly will need to be replaced. The electrical checks can be made with a multi-meter.\n\nDisassembly of the pump will be required to determine if the impeller is the problem. The drain compartment is typically located beneath the circulating compartment. Remove the lower rack, spray arm, pump cover and filter assembly to gain access. Inspect the drain impeller for damage or wear and replace if required. Also check that the food chopper is in good condition and not allowing large food particles to clog the drain outlet, and that both the chopper and impeller are turning freely.  Also if the soap is not dissolving, the water may not be hot enough.  Before starting a cycle on the dishwasher, turn the hot water tap on and let it run for a few minutes and then start the cycle.  You may have to vary the amount of soap you use as well.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

In such case, it rotates and then gets stuck on the heating element bracket. We would recommend replacing the lower spray arm, part number PS16542476, and installing it properly. We hope this helps."

The arms are not blocked of debris as I have checked them. I also looked into the diverter assembly and the ball is free so I think that is working. I guess my question is, how does the diverter valve work? if the rotation of the circulation pump flows one way, then how does the ball on the diverter valve know which direction to go? Please let me know your thoughts. \n\nThank you",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dustin, thank you for reaching out. Based on our research, the diverter motor moves the diverter disc or ball into position so the ball can direct water through the upper and mid spray arms. We suggest that you take a closer look at the diverter assembly kit, part number PS7783379, to solve the issue. We hope this helps!"

No error codes or nothing, just finishes with the clean message and no sanitize message on the panel. Actually if dishes are to dirty, at the end some ones don't get well clean. I know that in order to accomplish the tasks mentioned above, the water has to be hotter than the one that is supply and the part in charge of maintain the water hot and make i t hotter, is the heater. I disassembled the heater and checked for continuity with a multimeter and it looks ok, multimeter beeps as long as i touch both ends on the place the cables connectors go.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Eric,\n\nThanks for your question. Number 020 is the yellow catch. Number 022 is the blue catch. Number 025 is the green catch. If the catch you are replacing has an 18 on it or if it is silver, use the 020 yellow catch. If nothing matches check if your dryer has one catch, and make sure it is not a 27\" Wide Laundry Center or a Commercial Stacked Pair and if that is true, use the 020 yellow catch. If it is either of those types of machines, use the 025 green catch. If your dryer has two catches, use the 022 blue catch on the top and the 020 yellow catch on the bottom.\n\nI hope this helps."

Here is what's happening;  when i have the dryer set to start and close the door, the dryer makes a soft whirring/clicking sound.  When i push the start button, there is a loud click, the whirring stops, but the dryer does not start.  Do these symptoms give any indication of which part might be faulty?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Erin,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a couple of other parts that you would check to see if they are working correctly. The first part I would actually suggest testing is your start switch. You may also want to test your thermal fuse as well. You can test both parts with a multi meter to see what the continuity is on them. If both of those parts are fine you might go on to test your thermostats and your element as well. If those parts are fine then it may be your timer that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

I will order the latch anyway but I am wondering if anything else could be wrong? In addition, the light burned out. Does it require the exact replacement bulb?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Gerald,\n\nThanks for your question. The door catch kit would be the most likely solution for your problem based on your description. As for the bulb, we are only showing one bulb that is compatible with your machine based on the manufacturer's part list.\n\nI hope this helps."

The catch can be swapped to the other side yes but it sounds like there could be an issue with the door switch,PartSelect Number PS3653055.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Morgan, thank you for your question. These would be the instructions from the manufacturer: This kit contains (2) door strikes and various door catches. Some dryers may use more than (1) catch. Note numbers stamped on the catches and/or color of the spring steel, 20 (yellow), 22 (blue) or 25 (green). Match the number and/or color, of the catch being replaced with the catch supplied in the kit. If the catch you’re replacing has an 18 stamped on it or is silver in color, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. The (2) door strikes contained in the kit are the same. Please replace the door strike(s) with the appropriate number of door catches being used for this repair. If you cannot match the number on the catches, match the catch(es) by the following: 1. If your dryer has one catch and is not a 27” Wide Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. If it is a 27” Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 25 (green) for replacement. 2. If your dryer has 2 catches, use the catch stamped with 22 (blue) on the top and the catch stamped 20 (yellow) on the bottom.  I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Based on the repair instructions, I removed the fascia panel at the bottom of my dishwasher to expose the cable and spring setup for my model dishwasher, cleaned the area and installed the new parts - it took only a few minutes - then I replaced the panel and secured it with the sheet metal screws that were holding it in place. I opened the dishwasher door. My wife had already cleaned the corners of the tub where the old baffles had been, so I pressed the new baffles into place with my fingers - no tools were required for baffle installation.

Visibility is limited and an extra set of hands to hold the panels in position while you start the screws is really helpful. Other wise, it's just a matter of hooking the cable eyelets onto the door, routing the cables over the nylon rollers, hooking one end of the spring to one of the cables and stretching it across to hook into the other cable. It's easier to do the rear spring first and to use the lower tension spring first if, like mine, the two springs ae different tension. Read less"

One problem with dealing with a 19 year old dishwasher is that the plastic screw supports on the top/front outside cover tend to break off as they are brittle. This is a real problem on reassembly. I used super glue on some of the plastic part s that I could find. The glue job did not always hold. Consequently, the inside cover is a bit loose on the top, but all is working great. We should get a few more years out of this machine, which now works great.The 2 parts (Computer board and switch handle) should both probably always be put in on the repair, since it is already taken apart.

It doesn’t matter where i turn the knob. It behaves like this in all positions. Is this a latch/switch issue?",

The dishwasher still doesn't start unless i push the door really hard closed. I even moved the hook-latch (ps2098991) back so the door would close more, but now it's really hard to close the door. Even so, it will start if i continue to push and hold the door, but it stops when i let go. Is there some lower door adjustment? From the side it looks like the bottom of the door is much closer to the frame(?) than the top of the door is. I think if the bottom can be move out a bit, it would work. Please advise. Thanks in advance!!",

I didn't want to order this $53 dollar plastic strip so I squeezed a couple of rubber pieces into the bottom of the side edges to hold the top panel. Placed the retaining strip in place and used a long strip of black duct tape at this bottom edge to hold it all. It works and the new panels make the dish washer look close to new,the black duct tape hardly shows. This works good for my 10+ year old dishwasher until it is replaced with one that has a better door design. Read less"

They do press in rather hard though, so you have to use a bit of force to get them to snap in place. Follow these steps for step-by-step instructions:\n1: To replace the control cover on your dishwasher, you will need to pull the appliance a few inches away from the cabinet in order to fully remove the door.\n2: Use a quarter-inch socket or nut driver to remove the screws securing the lower access panel.\n3: Remove the panel along with any insulation and determine if the power line and water supply line have enough slack to move the dishwasher.\n4: Remove the panel along with any insulation and determine if the power line and water supply line have enough slack to move the dishwasher.\n5: If not, you will need to shut off the water supply valve then use channel–lock pliers to help unthread the water supply line fitting from the inlet valve to be prepared for some water to spill.\n5: Next, use a 5/16th inch socket or nut driver to unthread the screw, securing the junction box cover. Then pull the cover off.\n6: Unthread the strain relief nut and detach the strain relief from the junction box.\n7: Next, disconnect the drain hose from the sink or garbage disposer and feed it through the cabinet.\n8: Open the dishwasher door and remove the mounting bracket screws.\n9: Unhook both door cables from the hinges.\n10: Disconnect the door wire connecter and detach the wires from the retainer.\n11: Now open the door and lift up to remove it from the hinge supports.\n12: Use the quarter-inch socket or nut driver to unthread the two lower screws securing the hinges.\n13: Slide the hinges out.\n14: Now remove the upper screws securing the inner door panel to the outer panel.\n15: Slide the inner panel up to detach it. If still intact, lift the old control cover up and push forward to remove.\n16: Install the new control cover by aligning the cover tabs with the slots in the inner panel, then snap the cover into place.\n17: With the control cover installed, realign the tabs on the inner panel with the slots on the outer panel and slide the inner panel down.\n18: Replace the screws to secure the two panels.\n19: Reposition both door hinges on the support rails and replaces the screws to secure.\n20: Reinstall the door by aligning the hinge pins in the hinge supports.\n21: Close the door, then reconnect the door wire connecter and secure the wires in the retainer.\n22: Hook both door cables onto the hinges. Connect the wires using the wire nuts.\n23: Align the cover and replace the screw to secure. Reconnect the water supply line to the inlet valve.\n24: Replace any insulation then reposition the lower access panel. Secure it with the screws.\n25: With the repair completed, turn the water supply back on as well as the power and your dishwasher should be ready for use.\nWe hope that helps!"

Then removed the two beige metal pcs. . Next I replaced them with the 2 black pieces I had ordered and secured them with the 2 black screws I had received as part of my order. Th en I removed the scews from the inside of the door of my KitchenAid Dishwasher. This released both the front bottom panel and the control panel. . I took the beige bottom door panel off and moved the insulation piece from the back of thebeige panel to the back of the black panel. Then I intalled the new black panel I ordered and resecured it with two screws until I had finished with the control panel switch out.I had to unplug an electronic tape from the inside of the beige control panel and plug the same tape back into the black control panel. I also had to remove the beige handle that was on the inside of the control panel, attached to the door, and replace it with the new black one I'd received. I then installed the black control panel and reattached it with screws and finished replacing the rest of the screws I had removed from the inside of the door.I tested the handle to make sure it opened the door and locked it like it should and then went outside and turned the breaker back on. Came in and turned on the dishwasher and did a load of dishes. It looks awesome, matches the rest of my black appliances and I am very proud to have done it myself. I also wanted to thank the customer service lady who was so great to work with on the phone. I would shop with you again. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "I followed the PartSelect video to replace the feed tube assembly with spinner and the spray arm seal for the middle wash arm. Washing performance was better, but a couple weeks later the dishes on the bottom rack suddenly stopped getting clean. I decided I probably needed a new chopper assembly, which is identified by PartSelect as the cause of problem for 48% of the cases of dishes not getting clean. Before ordering the chopper assembly, however, I followed the video about how to replace the chopper assembly to determine whether the chopper assembly seemed to be worn out (the video shown at https://www.partselect.com/PS11722146-Whirlpool-W10083957V-Chopper-Assembly.htm). It was worse than I anticipated. I found the holes of the chopper assembly screen blocked by food, and the spinner in front of the screen had broken apart. In addition to finding the pieces of the broken chopper assembly, I discovered a treasure chest of debris, including about 8 pieces of broken glassware, 3 twister ties, a half-inch button, a 3/4-inch screw, and dozens of small pieces of metal. I poured water into the area and used a kitchen baster to suck out the water with all the pieces of debris, finishing the clean-up with paper towels. I ordered a new chopper assembly to replace the broken one, and the part arrived in under 48 hours. I relied on the same video to install the new chopper assembly. The only tricky challenge was getting the new chopper assembly back into place. I first tried needle nose pliers in two sizes, as recommended in the video, but what worked much better for me was using two chop sticks that were each about 1/4 inch square from top to bottom. Needle nose pliers are slanted, but the chopsticks did not vary in thickness and separated the screen from the spinner an even distance apart, making it easier to get the gear shaft on the chopper assembly to align in a straight line with the gear shaft on the pump motor. I also rotated the two gear shafts so the gears of the chopper assembly would mesh correctly with the gears of the pump motor shaft. The video cannot show that step very well because the man's hand blocks vision of how exactly to fit the chopper assembly into place. The video also fails to warn about possible debris around the chopper assembly and to explain how to clean out the debris. After finishing installing the chopper assembly my 14-year-old dishwasher cleaned my dishes as well as a new dishwasher. I spent a total of $110.24 on parts and shipping and invested a couple of hours total. The alternative would have been to spend $800 on a new dishwasher or wash dishes by hand. I am very, very happy with the outcome. Read less"

Replacing the seal may help with the issue of the spray arm not cleaning the top rack properly. However, if this does not solve the problem, you can visit our repair help section to determine what other parts could cause this symptom. I hope this helps you, and good luck with the repair."

If the dishes on the upper rack are not getting clean, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the chopper assembly, the spinner kit, the spray arm seal, sump pump check valve, the spray arm seal, the impellar and seal kit, the heating element, the circulation pump and motor, the lower spray arm support/hub, the water supply manifold probe and the feed tube assembly with spinner.

If the puck motor is defective, it can cause a lot of noise and not pump the water to the spray arms allowing it to reach the soap dispenser to use the soap. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

It applies tension to the dishwasher door through the door hinge to prevent the door from dropping too quickly when you open the dishwasher. You may need to replace it to fix the issue.

Main board had a more than one volt higher than listed voltage output. Manual does not list an acceptable voltage range so I ordered a new main board. New board had the same output and did not fix the problem. I ordered a new UI board. The new board is a genuine GE \"programable\" replacement board that covers multiple models.I set the indicated jumper to the required position for my application and installed it. The problem was not corrected. I read that some people had problems with defective replacement boards so I contacted PartSelect to return the first two boards and reordered the UI board.I once again set the jumper and installed the UI board and it worked immediately. The whole repair was extremely easy. PartSelect is very good to work with. I had no problems with returns or refunds. I will definitely use them again if I have the need for any of their products. There were slightly cheaper suppliers, but PartSelect had the parts I needed in stock and they shipped my order lightning fast. They are more than worth the few extra pennies difference. Read less"

This one worked best for me / my model.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sesf0BS8fzMThe first few I watched were for models with the user display on the top of the door, and you have to open the dishwasher to see it . Mine shows the display on the outside. Look for the video that has a round plastic \"vent\" on the inside of the door. You will have to loosen it with some sort of tool in order to remove the display once you get the door taken apart. In the video, they used needle-nose pliers opened wide. My NN pliers don't open that wide, so I used two screw drivers. Pealing off the display is a bit challenging. I was afraid I was going to break the little plastic pins that hold it on. The rest is not too hard though, and it went back together quite easily, even though I did break a plastic piece that 0ne of the UI Control Board screws goes into. Oh well, now it has three screws holding it instead of four. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Chuck,\nThank you for your question.  Before you begin any repair please turn the power to the dishwasher off at the circuit breaker. Use a quarter inch socket or nut driver to remove the screws securing the access panel.  Remove the panel along with any insulation.  Next remove the 2 inner screws securing the control board support panel.  Disconnect the door wire connector from the panel.  Use a 5/16th inch socket or nut driver to remove the screw securing the junction box cover and remove it.  After you have done this, you can drop the support panel down.  Note the orientation of the control board wires and then remove them from the board.  Using the quarter inch socket or nut driver, remove the grounding screw.  Then use pliers to squeeze the mounting pins to remove the old board securing the panel.  You can now install the new control board.  Align the board on the support panel and snap it into the mounting pins and then secure it with the grounding screw.  Reattach the wires to the new board.  With the wires aligned in the slot, reposition the support panel and secure them with the screws.  Reconnect the door wire connector.  Realign the junction box cover and secure it with the screw.  Reinsert the insulation.  Reposition the lower access panel and secure it with the screws.  You can now restore power to the dishwasher, and it should now work for you.   We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

That should hopefully clear this problem.\nIf this does not fix this problem then your door latch PS6447681 and striker PS8690622 might be faulty( this happens in 74 % off these symptoms), you should check the part(s) for signs of damage or test with a multimeter, and replace the part(s) as needed. If they check out ok then you would have to consider changing the Control board. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance."

This valve opens in order for the water to drain out of the dishwasher. You can also test the part with a Multimeter. When your multi-meter is set the R x 1 setting, place each of the meter's probes on one terminal each. When the probes touch the terminals, the reading should change from a reading of infinity to a reading of approximately 40 ohms. If you receive a reading of infinity, or a reading that is no where near 40 ohms, then you will need to replace the solenoid. We hope this helps!"

If the other cycle buttons are working except for the start/cancel button the issue would be with the Touchpad and Control Panel 5304475578 or the PC BOARD ASSEMBLY 5304475571.

        "customerQuestion": "Will replacing the timer fix the problem of the timer stopping in the middle of the dishwasher cycle and not continuing to complete the cycle?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Louis,\nThank you for your question.  If the timer is stopping mid-cycle, there may be an issue with the heating element.  If the heating element malfunctions, this will sometimes cause the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle.  To test the element, set your multi-meter to Rx1 and touch each probe to a terminal. Your reading should be somewhere between zero and infinity, refer to your owner’s manual to determine what reading you should receive for your model. If it is exactly zero or infinity it is defective. If your test produces a reading different from the manufacturer’s recommendation, you will need a replacement heating element. If the element is fine then check the timer.  Set your multi-meter to Rx1000 and touch the contacts with the probes. Most functioning timers will fall in the range of 2000-3500 ohms of resistance, but this varies between models. Refer to your owner's manual to determine what reading your test should produce. If your test results differ from the manufacturer's recommendations, you will need a replacement timer. We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

I followed the youtube video - turned the electricity off, unscrewed the old panel from the door, detached the old parts and attached the new part. Actually the inside of the handle was broken a few years ago when someone came to replace a reca lled part. The handle was still there, but broken and detached. I was able to see the problem and attach it properly to the place it was designed for in this new panel. As I attempted to put the panel back into position, I noticed a loose wire that I hadn't removed. It must have pulled loose when I took the panel off. I looked at the black part and was eventually able to see where it might have come off. I plugged it in and I put the panel back into the door. I have not run it yet. I just finished the repair. I did turn the electricity back on and the lights come on and it started. I turned it off until morning when I will be able to be there and make sure it works properly...P.S. .... This morning I am running my dishwasher. All seems well. Thank you for making these parts available. I am happy I was courageous enough to attempt this repair and to have it be successful. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jason, thank you for your question. According to our research, a damaged or faulty bi-metal fuse, part number PS2360984, could be the reason your dishwasher has no power. Check the bi-metal fuse with a multi-meter for continuity. If the bi-metal fuse works, then you will need to replace the control board, part number PS12349161. The control board does not include the door latch. The door latch, part number PS11754317, can be ordered separately. Please submit a new question if you have any follow-ups."

You would actually have to replace your whole control panel as the touch pad does not come separately from that plastic housing it is attached to. It is generally a pretty easy installation.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Sharon, Thank you for your inquiry. We have researched the model number that you have provided and it could be an issue with the control panel or the control board. The easiest way to test is to disconnect the power from the dishwasher, open up the door panels, and unplug the control panel cable from the control board. Leaving the door open and the cable unplugged, reassemble the door, then turn the power to the dishwasher back on. Wait 10 minutes and then close the dishwasher door. If the issue is with the control panel, the control board will recognize the control panel is unplugged and turn the drain pump on, and the control panel touchpad is at fault. If it doesn't, then the issue is with the control board. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order for a part, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

Th en I removed the scews from the inside of the door of my KitchenAid Dishwasher. This released both the front bottom panel and the control panel. . I took the beige bottom door panel off and moved the insulation piece from the back of thebeige panel to the back of the black panel. Then I intalled the new black panel I ordered and resecured it with two screws until I had finished with the control panel switch out.I had to unplug an electronic tape from the inside of the beige control panel and plug the same tape back into the black control panel. I also had to remove the beige handle that was on the inside of the control panel, attached to the door, and replace it with the new black one I'd received. I then installed the black control panel and reattached it with screws and finished replacing the rest of the screws I had removed from the inside of the door.I tested the handle to make sure it opened the door and locked it like it should and then went outside and turned the breaker back on. Came in and turned on the dishwasher and did a load of dishes. It looks awesome, matches the rest of my black appliances and I am very proud to have done it myself.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello BRANDON and thanks for writing.\nOpen the dishwasher and slide the upper dish rack out. Next, lift it up off the rails to remove it entirely. Set the upper dish rack aside.\n\nNext, remove the plastic cap off the back of the broken rail. To remove it, all you have to do is twist the top towards the middle of the dishwasher and then pull the rest of the part free. Set it aside and then pull the rail out of the dishwasher.   We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime."

I would like to replace the entire rail rather than just replace one part of the full rail unit.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Greg, thank you for reaching out. The part you mentioned is only the inner rail, part number PS959486. To replace the entire rail assembly, you may need to order the end cap, part number PS958986, the bearing cage, part number PS959485, and the rack wheel, part number PS11721507. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week!"

I then slid the replacement track into the housing, being sure that the bearing bracket cleared, and bent the stop back into place. I then repositioned the rack into the track and put the front stops back into place. Job finished!! My choice of terminology may not be accurate, but it worked, not once but twice.

You will need to make sure any screws securing the dishwasher are removed at the top front of the dishwasher under the counter and above the top of the dishwasher. Then pull the dishwasher out exposing roughly 18\" of each side of the dishwasher then use a socket to remove the screws holding the tracks in place, 4 in total on each side. Then install new tracks and slide dishwasher back into place and secure.\" Hope this helps!"

I'm trying to find a part # in order to order a replacement. Any help would be much appreciated.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello John, thank you for writing. The best way to approach this would be for you to ask them for the model number from the inside of the dishwasher so that we can confirm the correct parts. However, by keying in the \"Whirlpool Quite Partner III\" on the internet, there was a model come us as GU2300XTVQ0. So, based on that model, the part that connects the upper rack to the rail it slides on is called Upper Rack Roller PartSelect Number PS12347743. We hope this helps."

It popped out. I put the new white sleeve and then the caster wheel into the now open hole, slowly set the dishwasher back up and let it drop the last 2 inches. That pushed the w heel securely up into the sleeve. The entire replacement took less than 2 minutes! Super easy. Read less"

Got it back up right, hooked it up and ran it. I am disabled with nerve damage to my arms and hands. The average person could have done this in about 10 mins. It is just like it is brand new now.

        "storyTitle": "Broken wheel, broken fingers",
        "repairInstruction": "The rear right caster (wheel) under our fairly new portable dishwasher broke. Upon looking up the part, I discovered that it did not bolt into place, meaning that the exterior skin of the dishwasher did not have to be removed and that more than likely I could fix it myself.The replacement wheels from Partselect were nicer qual ity than what the original was and showed up just two days after they were ordered.However, getting what remained of the broken caster out was frustrating. I am not unhandy around the house, having put in two new bathrooms and a staircase.But after yanking and prying on the broken caster for 20 minutes (slamming my fingers into the floor every time the pliers slipped), I could see where most people would give up and call a repairman. Finally, with help from small pry bar, the broken caster popped loose. Thankfully, putting the new in was as simple as sliding it into place.Unfortunately, after all that work, we discovered the new caster was slightly taller than the old, leaving the dishwasher with a distinct wobble that my wife said was unacceptable. She, of course, had not been repeatedly introducing her hand to the floor.I had ordered two replacement casters, thinking that another of the originals might break. But getting the second one out proved just as difficult as the first, even with the help of the pry bar. After much cussing and kissing of finger booboos, our Maytag dishwasher is as good as the day we brought it home. Read less"

Average quote was for $100 as a service call to check it out. I removed the front door coverge and determined it was the controller. Cheched with an Ohmeter ($9.00 unit) for shorts and found none. The new controller was insta lled together with the other parts and I now have a unit like new that would have cost $1,400.00 to replace. The schematics and parts diagram were invaluable. You also saved about $50.00 over the GE website. Thanks. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "I followed the instructions on a PartSelect U-Tube video showing how to replace the air inlet. It took me two attempts on two different days because the instructions for removing the 5 screws holding the air inlet in place were over-simplified. Accessing the screws was much more difficult than was demonstrated in the video. On day 1 I followed the instructions for removing the door panel to gain access, but, after many failed attempts to get the nut driver properly seated on the screw heads holding the air inlet to the door, I replaced the panel so the dishwasher could be used until I found a solution to the problem. After doing online research, I discovered a nut driver with a flexible shaft; it looked like it would allow me to properly seat the nut driver on the screw heads. Next day, I was able to replace the air inlet with no problem. It took me a little over an hour from start to finish. Aligning the holes of the new air inlet with the holes on the door so it could be screwed in place was awkward and time consuming but persistence worked. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Leakage along bottom of door panel during wash/rinse",
        "repairInstruction": "The air inlet strip has a flap and two smaller side flaps that seal the bottom of the inner door to the bottom pan that hold the water. The flaps don't form a watertight seal as they only serve to prevent the water surging during wash and rinse cycles from splashing out of the bottom pan onto the floor under the door. What I learned aft er dismantling the door is that the problem I was having with water dripping from the bottom of the bottom of the outer door was being caused by a loose upper round louvered vent and not he lower vent strip. If the lower vent strip were the problem, water would leak from the front lip of the bottom pan, which is located well behind the face of the front door panel.Here's my recommendation on the lower vent srtip repair. Turn off the power to the unit at you breaker panel. The air inlet strip is fastened to the backside of the inner stainleess steel door panel. To access the screws the outer door panel must be removed. Open the door and remove the six torx head screws that fasten the outer door panel to the stainless steel inner door. Don't remove the two torx screws top dead center as they hold the door latch. After removing the screws, raise the door up to the nearly closed position. Lift up the outer door panel handle and door bottom to disengage the outer panel from the inner stainless door. The next part is a little tricky since the vent strip hex head screws are at he bottom of the stainless door panel, facing out with the door closed. The lip of the bottom stainless pan is high enough to make it a tight fit to access the screws. There is also a steel bracket that is a door stiffener and holds electrical wiring. I found removing the bracket held by a 1/4\" hex head screw on each side made access to the vent strip scews easier. Lay flat on the floor. With a 3/16\" nutdriver or socket wrench each of the five vent strip screws can be removed. It's a tight fit between the bottom lip and door bottom, but it can be done. Remove the old vent strip and attach the new one. Make sure it fits snugly into the slot. Best to have an extra pair of hands at this point to hold the stip securely in place while screws are reinserted from the opposite side. Reassemble everything in reverse order.It was when I had the outer door panel off that I noticed my problem was water getting past the upper round louver vent seal and thus running down the inside of the outer panel. Simple fix was to remove and clean the scale residue from the parts and door. Then reassemble the vent and twitst tighten the vent to compress the rubber seal on the inside face of the door.

        "storyTitle": "LLeaking at bottom of door -Lower part of inlet damaged",
        "repairInstruction": "REMEMBER TO SHUT OFF POWER _ Had to remove the screws using TORX driver on the inside door edge-- then came the hard part -- the foam insulation is glued to the inner door and the outer cover- I was able to finally separate the cover leaving the foam on the inner door. Then had to break off the foam insulation on the lower third of the d oor up from the bottom. I then had access to the screws holding the air inlet to the door. The screws are located so you can't get a straight shot at them and it is very difficult to get at them. These screws are hex head metric and very small. When they are removed the old air inlet will come right off. Take the new one and duct tape it in place inside the door and replace the screws. I recommend doing the outer ones first and since they are the easiest to get started, then you can fight the others a little easier. After the screws are replaced and tightened replace the lower half of the insulating foam by duct taping it to the foam that remained on the inner door. Then replace the outer cover and secure with the TORX screws. This was a time consuming and tough repair. I don't recommend it to a novice. Read less"

The vent drives the moist air down a condensation tube, where remaining drops of moisture are released within the door to a moisture proof trough in the lower inner door. When the moisture reaches this part of the door, the moisture has been reduced to a few drops and then drains back into the bottom of the tub. If you are getting a lot of moisture the vent may not be working. Hope this helps!"

If so, you may need to replace the some components on the inner door. Inspect the dispenser cover PS11755469, the Dispenser Mounting Bracket PS11755103 and Dispenser PS11754648. We are pleased to have been able to help."

This is after I had 3 other repair men come and try to fix the leak. They said they could not find the problem of the leak and said we were using to much soap. When I pulled out the uni t and started it up you could clearly see the water leaking from the air inlet seal. I was very happy with Parts Select my parts were shipped the same day as my order and I received them the very next day.

Unplug timer and remove screws holding timer in place. Reverse process to install new timer.Drain solenoid - (a little harder):Turn off water to dishwasher under sink and disco nnect from plumbing. Disconnect drain line. Remove any screws holding dishwasher in place and start pulling unit from it's cavity. It should come about half way out. At this time you can peer under the unit and see the drain solenoid.If you don't know what you're doing (like me) I recommend the following. Remove the water line from the dishwasher (and possibly the drain line) It should now be easy to pull the unit all the way out and tip it on it's side, fully exposing the drain solenoid. Note: The drain solenoid provided to me was encapsulated in a different bracket than the original one in my dishwasher unit. It was necessary to pry the solenoid out by bending the bracket and installing in the original bracket. Then squeeze back together in a vice with a few gentle love taps with a hammer to squeeze it all back together. It was still a little loose but the solenoid just goes up and down so no big deal.There's a little metal clip holding the white plastic arm to the drain valve. Let's say this O represents the diameter of the metal rod it's hooked to. That clip is removed by a small screwdriver pushing the clip away from that rod, this way: 0 ==> It will make sense once you do it.From there it's pretty easy to replace the solenoid unit and reverse the steps above to re-install the unit.Chris Read less"

Put the new one in, and the timer rotates fine, however water is no longer coming into the dishwasher. Put the old timer back in and manually rotated it and water comes in no problem. So we figured the old timer's electrical motor i s burned out, and the new timer's signaling function is probably a bit different. Turns out the motor is really easy to remove, just pry the metal latch out a bit with a flat screwdriver and out it comes. We put the motor from the new timer on our old timer, and presto, everything works! Like other reviewers said here, pop off the seven screws and the interior door panel comes right off. Disconnect the power plug, signal plug and ground plug and reverse the procedure. Really easy repair. Make sure you shut off the fuse panel before starting the repair. Read less"

My dishwasher uses a square plug for the timer functions, motor, drain, etc. I cannot locate the original style timer mechanism. Can you help?",

I believe the part i need is the plastic strip on top and screws (Whirlpool retainer,  black) can you tell me if this is what is missing to attach part to dishwasher? And if so is it only one piece on top or is there one on bottom too? 2nd question if i buy a new access panel black (ap6008143) do i still need the retainer to attach that piece? Or does the new access panel have attachments? Please send response to email : Torresn@co.Monterey.Ca.Us",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Norma, the bottom of your appliance has multiple pieces that keep it together. Starting from the very bottom you have the Toe Panel with Insulation, part number PS11741359, which is held in place by two screws, part number PS11740645, then you have The Extension, part number PS11741327, that sits on top of that. Then on top of that is the door trim, and so on. We not able to locate part number  ap6008143 on your model. If you would like us to take a more thorough look with you please call us at 1-888-260-4310. Hope this helps!"

You can test them with a multi meter and they should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. If that part is fine you should go on to check these parts: your turbidity sensor, overflow control switch, and thermostat. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Something that you can do is cut the power to your appliance for about 5 minutes. If after you plug it back in, you still get the problem, you may have to replace the board. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Press a series of four buttons in quick succession.

Then I unscrewed the two remaining screws holding the control panel onto the door. I also removed the two screws holding the door latch in position. With all screws remove d the control panel simply slid off the top of the door. Inside the control panel, I used a small screw drive to pry the retainer clips back from the edge of the electronic control board. The control panel then snaps out. I disconnected the ribbon cable from both boards and reinstalled the new ribbon cable. I then reattached the ribbon cable to the new electronic control board and snapped the new control board into place. I reinstalled the control panel and tested the \"Normal\" position to insure the dishwasher would respond appropriately. After checking for proper operation, I reinstalled all screws,including the door latch and the front cover. Operation complete. Read less"

I looked up the part and it is listed as No Longer Available/Discontinued sorry. There are no part substitutions listed. Our suggestion here would be to call the manufacturer and see if they can provide you with a substitution for these part numbers. We hope this helps."

I ordered the SS front and handle to update the look of the 4 year old DW and it was a really good idea. * screws later and it was done. The 'repair' took 15-20 minutes and the results are amazing. BTW...the parts took less than 2 business days to arrive... Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Kathy, thank you for the question. Based on our research, we would recommend checking the dryer cycling thermostat, part number PS11745959. It monitors and regulates the temperature inside the dryer. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. We hope this solves your problem!"

        "customerQuestion": "Dryer no power what can i do",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Tai, thank you for your question. There are a few parts you will want to test to determine if they have failed and caused this issue. We would recommend testing the Part Number: WP3392519 thermal fuse, Door Switch - 3 Wire Part Number: WP3406107, and Thermostat, Internal-Bias Part Number: WP8577274. Testing the thermostats is an easy process. Set your multimeter to the R X 1 setting. Take each of your meter's probes and touch one to each terminal. You are testing for continuity, and you should receive a reading of either zero or infinity. At room temperature, testing the thermostat should produce a reading of zero. But if a thermostat is tested when it is heated to its limit, a reading of infinity should be produced. We strongly recommend that you test your thermostat at room temperature. If those parts are tested and are fine, please check the power cord and terminal block a well as the outlet that the unit is plugged into. I hope this helps!"

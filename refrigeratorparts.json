In bottom-freezer refrigerators, the filter is in the bottom left grille. In top-freezer units, the filter is located in the middle of the refrigerator. This NSF certified filter reduces 28 contaminants including pharmaceuticals, metals, minerals, pesticides, cysts, industrial chemicals, Class I Particulates and chlorine. It is made up of coconut carbon block and has three layers of filtration. The first layer is particle filtration that helps block larger contaminants. The second layer is micro-filtration, which prevents medium-sized impurities from passing. The third layer is called absorption filtration, which absorbs microscopic-sized pollutants. It measures 2 inches deep, 2 inches wide, 1-1/2 inches high, and weighs 0.5 lbs. To ensure your filter is working its best, it needs to be replaced every six months. This single filter has a simple, quick-turn installation feature that does not require any tools.",

    "description": "This Drive Belt is 89.5\" long and comes in black, featuring four ribs on the inside for a better grip. This is a long belt that wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pulley, allowing all the parts to work together, spinning the drum as the motor rotates. If the drum will not turn when the dryer is turned on the belt is likely broken. It is common for belts to stretch or become brittle over time, which is what leads to the breakage. If broken, it should be replaced; the drum simply cannot spin without this belt. Refer to your model number and user manual to check if this part is right for you. Ensure you use work gloves to protect your hands from sharp internal parts during this repair. Please note: When comparing the length of your old belt to the length of the belt as stated here, remember that a small amount of stretching and contortion may occur with belts over time for a range of different reasons. Unless your belt is drastically different in length, this belt is what you are looking for despite any small inaccuracies. You will need to remove power to your appliance, remove the main panel, and access the motor drive to slip your new belt back into place.",

        "repairInstruction": "Parts were shipped quickly, packaged correctly, and were in original GM packages - very reassuring. BTW, your customer service is excellent.Reviewed YouTube videos.Patience is required, take your time, take photos of the wires and also make a written wiring chart. This was the flaw in my planning. Reference the schematics f rom PartsSelect to number the controls. Do NOT use masking tape to identify the wires as they will have all stuck together by the time you go to reinstall them. Most difficult process was removing and identifying the numerous wires to the back panel. They have push connectors, but some were very difficult to remove. The people doing the \"how to\" videos no doubt had them partially released and that made it look easy. Examine the connectors before removing to identify how they are captured by the connector. A paper clip \"tool\" I made enabled me to release some of the capture lugs, but some were so tight, I had to use small needle-nose pliers to open up the lug to release the wire on the connector. When reinstalling, re-tighten those connectors.Replacing the parts was much easier than the wiring disconnect/reconnect process. I'm happy to report that replacing the rear bearing and the front 2 green and 2 white shim/bearings immediately and completely solved my problem. For about $150, I restored my dryer to \"like-new\" functionality and got a lot of satisfaction from doing it. The project took about 4 hours, which could have been reduced to 2 hours had I know about the clip release and wiring identification process. Also, make sure you thoroughly vacuum out your unit while it is disassembled. Good luck!!! Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Excessive Drum Noise While Drying Clothes",
        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

If you are replacing the front bearing slides in your dryer you will need 2 lower slides WE1M504, which are white. You will also need two upper slides WE1M1067, which are green.

Are there any other parts I should order to stop the noise? Thanks for the help!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Nina, great question. Changing your front bearings would be your first step as worn ones can cause loud noises throughout the drying cycle. To change the upper bearings, you will need 2 of WE1M504 and 2 of WE1M1067. If you decide to also change the rear bearing which would be the second most common cause for the noise, the part would be WE25M40. Let us know if you have any further questions."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Bobby,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. Your belt could be the issue. If it has worn down so much that maybe it is slipping against the pulley. However it is more likely that you will have to replace either your bearing slides or your pulley. I would check all of these parts to see which one of them are causing your problem. They are all physical parts, so when you look at them you should be able to determine which one is causing the problem for you. The belt and the slides would be parts that get worn down, the pulley is just something that you turn the wheel on and you will hear if it is making the squeaking noise. Good luck with your repair."

You can check the belt to make sure it is not wore out and and preventing the drum to turn as it should.You can also check the Rear Drum Bearing for wear. Make sure the appliance is getting proper air flow. Clean the Lint Trap Duct Assembly and the Air Vents. You can use a Multi Meter to test the High Limit Thermostat and the Bias Thermostat as well for proper continuity. Hope this helps!"

It is always recommended to replace both of them at the same time.  If your dryer is taking a long time to dry and the front seal I would recommend replacing it as this is likely causing the issue.

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

For the green drum slides you can order part number WE1M1067, and for the white you can order part number WE1M504. Although only your green drum slides need replacing at the moment, we strongly advise replacing both the green and the white (upper and lower) together for an even wear.

Funny thing, I'm looking at it on your website! Do I need to replace the slides that she installed, or can I take them off and put them onto a new bearing, along with a set of new white ones? Also, can I re use the felt pieces or can they be ordered? Thank you!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Karen, Thank you for the question. The \"Green\" Slide, Part #: PS6447706 is more of a black in color. You would be able to reuse then on the New Front Tub Bearing, Part #: PS960316. We also recommend replacing the White Slides, Part #: PS755842. We hope this helps!"

I was told that I would have to submit photos of the broken parts to photos@replaceparts.com, which I did. After I submitted the photos, I received an email asking me for the photos again and the serial number of the refrigerator. This is the first time the serial number was requested. I have no idea why they wanted the serial number at this point instead of when I first ordered the parts. At this point, I am still waiting to get my claim for the broken parts approved. I assume that the shipping department is pretty worthless, since they screwed up my order to begin with and then the shabby packing that was done for such fragile plastic parts on the reorder.I'm not happy with the hassle that I have been going through just to get a simple order delivered.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Vanessa, if your door shelf bin has warped over time we recommend replacing it right away. Although it may hold all the items in your fridge for the moment, if it does break off it could further damage other parts in your fridge. This could potentially make a huge mess. Please let us know if you have any further questions."

        "customerQuestion": "I am working on a Kenmore french door refrigerator and tis short cycling it cut out when the temperature is about 56 in freeze come on at about 60 do i need to replace a temp sensor ore a control board i replace the relay, same thing",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Thomas, thank you for your question. There are no sensors listed for this model, but from the information provided it sounds like it may be an issue with the board in the unit or perhaps the run capacitor. This part provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. Doing so enables the appliance to effortlessly maintain its internal temperature. If the capacitor is faulty your refrigerator or freezer might be too warm, or you may notice the compressor will hum, but it will not run. When replacing your capacitor, you should check the old one for any signs of damage, overheating, or arcing, as that may suggest there is a bigger problem with your appliance. I hope this helps!"

Real issue is the frame design; it's bad. There is no support provided for the rear edge of the shelf at midspan, which causes the frame/center rail to bow and fatigue bac k there, eventually breaking with constant use of the crisper drawers coupled with shelf load. To remedy this, after replacement I cut a 6 inch length of 1\"x1\" post, painted it gloss white, and wedged it underneath the new frame right where the center rail attaches in the back (glass shelf below provides the wedge base). There is no interference with the drawers if the wedge is against the back wall, and you really can't see it. Should work to keep the stress off the plastic. Other ways are obviously possible; this is what I had around the house. Read less"

The drawer lid was another finesse it in without breaking the hinge tab so had to position it slightly on the diagonal and popped it into place.Now the crisper drawers glide silently and effortlessly along the side rails with the new center rail in place while the deli drawer lid raises itself automatically with a gentle grasp of the drawer pull.It had been so long since those parts had busted I had forgotten how the assembly was supposed to work.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi William,\nThank you for your question.  Here is information from your owner's manual on hot to remove and install a water filter in your refrigerator: It is not necessary to turn the water supply off\nto change the filter. Be ready to wipe up any small amounts of water released during the\nfilter replacement. 1 Turn Off the ice maker power switch.\n\t 2\t Remove the old filter by rotating it counterclockwise (to the left) 90 degrees to release it.\n\t 3\t Slide the old filter cartridge straight out of the housing and discard it.\n\t 4\t Unpackage the new filter cartridge. Slide it into the filter housing as far as it will go with the grip end horizontal.\n\t 5\t Push lightly inward on the filter while rotating it clockwise (to the right). The filter will then\npull itself inward as it is rotated. Rotate the filter 90 degrees until it stops and the grip end is vertical. You may be able to feel a very light click as the filter locks into place. 6 Press a drinking glass against the water dispenser while checking for any leaks at the filter housing. Any spurts and sputters\nthat occur as the system purges air out of the dispenser system are normal. 7 Continue dispensing water for 3-4 minutes or until 1.5 gallons of water has flowed through the system. You will likely need to empty and refill your glass several times. 8 Turn On the ice maker. 9 Press and hold the Water Filter reset button on the control panel for three seconds. When the display changes from\nRed to Green, the status has been reset.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

So can it be as simple as getting a new filter to get ice maker functioning again but the fact that door water dispenser still dispensing water makes me doubtful that ice makers problem would be clogged or dirty filter. Or would the whole ice maker  mechanism be faulty, therefore needing to replace with new? What is ice makers reason for no more ice??  2nd question, water filter is bad if light shows red/orange color when pressing water dispenser switch? i'm renting, so never knew fridge to have any other color of light to show from the filter indicator on the door control  panel.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Abe, Thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend checking the following parts: the water inlet valve, the tubes and the ice maker. You can test the water inlet valve with a multimeter to see if it has continuity. We have included a link on how to test your ice maker, scroll down to the ice maker section on the page. https://www.partselect.com/Repair/Refrigerator/Not-Making-Ice/\n\nThe water filter light is supposed to be green, so an amber/red light indicates that the filter needs to be replaced.

It sounds like the water is not flowing through the filter correctly. If the filter is re-installed and it doesn't fix the issue, replace the filter again with part number PartSelect Number: PS3412266. If that doesn't fix the issue, check  the water lines to the icemaker to be sure there is no ice buildup, kinks or blockages. I hope this helps!"

Replacing or not replacing the filter would only affect the water dispenser, not the icemaker. The most common reason an icemaker does not get water would be a defective water valve WPW10270395. I hope this helps."

A customer replacing the filter may have clicked the wrong option in error. I suggest checking to make sure the Damper Control Assembly is not stuck open and allowing too much cold air through from the freezer. You can check to see if the flapper has froze open or if there is something blocking the flapper not allowing it to close.Hope this helps!"

If there is a burning smell coming from the refrigerator and the refrigerator section is too warm, the wires maybe overheating or a part may have shorted out.  Also, check the coils on back of the refrigerator to make sure they are clean.  As refrigerant passes through the coils, heat is given off as the refrigerant cools.  If the coils are dirty, the temperature in the refrigerator will fluctuate.  Check the area around the compressor.  If this area is also dirty, the refrigerator may not operate normally.  Find out where the smell is coming from and check the parts in that area to see which is causing the issue.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Paul,\nThank you for your question.  There is no need to turn the water supply off to the refrigerator before replacing your filter.  To locate the filter look into the upper left corner of the refrigerator.  When you have located the filter, place a towel on the shelf just under where the filter is in case any water spills out.  Open the door and swing the filter to the right until it stops.  The filter will not release until it is in this position and simply pull the old cartridge out without twisting it.  Align the top of the new filter in the holder with the word front facing outward.  Firmly push the filter in until it engages to insure it is properly seated.  Again being careful not to twist the filter.  Swing filter back into place and close the filter door.  If your filter does not swing into place, make sure that it has been aligned and engaged properly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Azucena, Thank you for your inquiry. I would try taking the filter out and make sure the lines are clean. I have included the installation steps as well. If your fridge still is not dispensing water I would check your water inlet valve and the line that runs from it to the filter. Hope this helps! \n\nBefore removing the old filter, place a cloth beneath the filter to catch the few drops of water that may fall when the filter is removed. Grasp the filter and turn it to the left until it stops, while gently pulling downward from the filter head. Keep the filter level to minimize water spillage. (If the filter doesn't come loose easily, air may be trapped inside. To relieve any pressure, push in on the water dispenser; the filter should drop right out.) Remove and discard the plastic cap from the new filter. Fill the top of the replacement filter with water from the tap. Place the filter inside the cartridge holder by aligning the arrow on your filter with the cartridge holder. Push the filter gently upward to engage the top of the cartridge in the filter head. Slowly turn the filter to the right until the filter cartridge stops turning. As you turn the cartridge, it will automatically rise into position. After the filter has been replaced, trapped air must be purged out of the system. Select Water on the dispenser selector and press the pad until water begins to flow. The first few ounces of water may sputter due to air in the replacement filter. This is normal. Continue to dispense approximately 1-2 gallons of water to make sure all air is purged from the system."

To install the new filter, center it with the holder, making sure the word \"FRONT\" is facing forward and centered. Swing the filter inwards until it is positioned. Black Model: Pull on the bottom of the old cartridge to unlock it from the clips. Swing it outward until you hear a clicking sound. Now twist the cartridge one-quarter of a turn counter-clockwise. Pull it out to remove. To install the new filter, match the filter cartridge with the holder, making sure the word \"FRONT\" is facing the top of the appliance. Push the filter toward the back of the appliance until it is secured. Twist it clockwise one-quarter of a turn so the word \"FRONT\" is facing outward. Swing filter inward until it is secured.

If there is no ice obstructing the tube and cup, test the water inlet valve to be sure both ports on the valve are working. Here is a link on how to test the water valve. https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator+test-water-valve+repair.htm. You can also try to run the following test on the icemaker itself.Turn icemaker Off for 15 seconds and turn back on,Push in on paddle 3 times and only 3 times within 15 seconds of powering the icemaker back on.Within 3 minutes, the icemaker should enter the harvest mode.The heater will turn on for a about of 20 seconds, and the comb inside the icemaker will make one full revolution and return to the \"Home\" position.At the end of 3 minutes, the icemaker mold should fill with water.The green light under the ON/OFF switch should be on and steady.If this does not fix the issue you may need to replace the icemaker.

You will have to feel around to find the machine screws, but once you do, it is simple to slip the appropriate size socket over the hex heads. I found it helpful to have an extension on the socket wrench. Disconnect the power cable inside the refrigerator (there are little pressure clips on the side that help release the cable) and move it out of the way for the time-being.Back out both machine screws several turns, but do not remove them completely. The icemaker slips over the screws, so leaving them in the side of the refrigerator makes that process a lot easier. Hand tighten the machine screws once you have positioned the new icemaker in place. One thing to be sure and do is make sure the water line hose coming out of the back of the refrigerator inside is on top of the icemaker. It fits into a slot in the top of the icemaker - failing to do this will result in water pouring into the freezer compartment, not into the icemaker..Reconnect the power cable to the new icemaker and tuck it up behind the icemaker assembly. Tighten the machine screws completely, but do not over-tighten. Reconnect the water line on the back of the refrigerator at the wall, and plug in the refrigerator. You should hear the unit fill immediately. In about an hour you should have ice filling the bin. Enjoy! Read less"

A previous post indicated the solenoid should read between 500 and 1500 ohms. In checking, I read around 290 ohms, and confirmed the solenoid was ok. There were other items to ch eck, including the primary water inlet valve and filter. I confirmed water these were ok as the water dispenser on the unit worked properly, and the filter has been replaced on a regular basis. I Ordered a new Ice Maker (PN PS11738120) and replaced as directed in previous post. After several days, the new ice maker did not work. I removed the solenoid connector for the water dispenser which is located next to the ice maker solenoid on the inlet valve, and connected to the ice maker solenoid. I depressed the water flow switch located on the door and the solenoid opened, and dispensed water into the ice tray. I confirmed the solenoid was not the issue. I also was concerned about the ice maker over flow lever that is connected to the ice maker. this switch shuts off the ice maker if the ice level is too high. I checked the old ice maker and determined a blue and yellow wire were connected to the switch, and terminated in the buss connector that connects the ice maker and the refrigerator. in normal condition, the switch should be closed. when I checked the replacement ice maker, I found the switch was open, which kept power from turning on the water supply to the ice maker.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Carla,\nThank you for your question.  If you have just installed a new ice maker, please allow 24 hours before it starts to make ice.  The arm should be in the up position until it cycles. The ice maker has an automatic shutoff to keep the storage bin from overfilling during normal operation. As ice is made, the ice cubes will fill the ice storage bin, and the ice cubes will raise the shutoff arm to the OFF (arm up) position. When the storage bin is at full capacity, the ice maker will automatically stop ice production, but the ice maker On/Off switch will remain in the ON (up) position.  Try and press the on/off switch and then lowering the arm manually to see if this helps.  If it not you may have to refer to the diagnostics tech sheet that came with your refrigerator or contact Whirlpool for more information.    I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Ice maker not making ice. Will buying the complete ice maker fix problem or could the problem just be the water inlet valve",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ed, thank you for writing. More often than not on your model refrigerator, the Ice Maker itself would need to be replaced. This part number PS11738120 is the compatible replacement for your model. There is a chance that the water Inlet Valve, part number PS11753250 is the cause. You can inspect it for clogs and damage. I hope this helps, and good luck with your repair!"

Most times the cube tray does not return to the filling position. I can turn it off and later turn it on and it may make another tray of ice. But it can not be left alone.Do i need to splace the ice maker unit and how to i see the installation video?\n\nthank you",

Then, because I'm stubborn, I chose not to remove either of the basket/drawers. It took a little bit of effort to fit my arms/hands in there, but I was able to remove the bottom screw to the old icemaker, and loosen the two top screws. (And disconnect the wiring harness.) I could then lift the old icemaker up and off. Putting the new icemaker in was pretty easy-- just slide it down over the two top screws and connect the wiring harness. The hardest part was getting the bottom screw back in! Because I didn't remove the baskets/drawers, I had very little room to work, and I had to \"feel\" for where that bottom screw went (even used a little mirror to help me). I could have just left this screw out, as the icemaker was sitting in there quite securely. But I kept at it, and after about 20 minutes, I was able to line up the screw with the hole, balanced on the tip of the screwdriver, and get it screwed in. Total repair took about 45 minutes. And no more leaky ice maker! Read less"

This thermostat controls and regulates the ice maker ejection cycle by monitoring the temperature inside the freezer to determine when to release the ice into the bin and start the ice making cycle again. If your ice maker is making unusual noises, or if the ice maker is not making or dispensing ice, there could be an issue with the thermostat. You can test this thermostat with a multimeter to see if it has continuity. If the thermostat does not have continuity you would want to replace the thermostat itself. I hope this helps!"

If the ice is not dispensing, you can try to remove the ice container and let it sit out to thaw any ice build up within the container. If this does not fix the issue you can take the bin apart and check for any damaged parts within the container. You should be able to hear the motor in the container when it is trying to dispense. If the motor is not turning on to dispense, you may have a defective Motor, Part Number: PS11740462. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ken, thank you for your question. In most cases, if both of the solenoids on your water inlet valve are testing within 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance, then the problem would be with the ice maker not calling up water to start making the ice. Which means that you may have to replace your ice maker itself if the issue is not in your water valve. Good luck with your repair."

        "storyTitle": "Ice Maker was overflowing with water",
        "repairInstruction": "I could not determine if the solenoid water inlet valve or the ice maker unit was bad, so I replaced both. In this model of the refrigerator, the freezer is a drawer on the bottom, so this makes access to the ice maker mounting a little tricky. The need to contort to reach into the back made this take longer and was more uncomfort able than expected. I needed to completely remove the screws for the top brackets, even though most instructions indicate you can loosen these and lift the ice maker off. Be careful to properly re-seat the water guide that directs the water from the inlet tube to the ice maker. That tended to interfere with re-connecting the wiring harness to the back of the freezer. Again, this was likely difficult because of having to bend over into the freezer. The ice maker needs to be in the freezer for about 12 hours before the sensor in the black wire is cool enough to allow operation. I did not know this at first, so I was initially worried that there was a bigger problem. If you want to use the test functions with a jumper wire, be sure the door switch that controls the freezer light is depressed. The solenoid value replacement was fairly straightforward. I found it useful to use a small open wrench to push the compression lock for the value-to-ice maker water tube to remove the old solenoid. Otherwise, replacing the water valve was simple. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Victoria,\n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest testing your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids, one for your water inlet valve and one for your ice maker. It could be that the solenoid for your ice maker might be malfunctioning. You can test your part with a multi-meter. This test is fairly simple, all you have to do is set you multi-meter to the lowest setting. The calibrate it until the needle is on zero. You will then take each prob to the terminals inside of the plugs for each of your water inlet valve's solenoids. If the solenoid is reading 500 - 1500 ohms, then your valve is fine. However if your reading is close to or stays on zero, you will have to replace your valve. Also check your fill tube as well, it could be that there is an ice build up in the tube and it is blocking water from getting to your ice maker. I hope this helps you. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jasper, unfortunately if your icemaker is making a clicking sound, that is a sign that it needs replacing. You can order that here D7824706Q. As for the installation process, it is not a difficult repair. You will need to remove a few screws, unplug the wires to the assembly, and attach the new one.

        "customerQuestion": "The ice maker in the freezer section of my Jenn-Air (your website says manufacturer part number d7824706q- the data plate inside the fridge says part number uki2500axx) ) is leaking water into the ice pan. The ice maker works, it makes ice, the bail works but i am getting a block of ice forming in the ice pan every few days. I looked under the ice mold when water was running in from fill cup and it appears that water is leaking along the front edge of the mold and  i suspect the ice maker needs to be replaced (it's 13 years old.) also, i am finding a glaze of ice on the floor of the freezer and, occasionally (once or twice a week), a small puddle of water on the floor under the fridge. It appears to me that water is working its way down through the freezer from the ice maker because i' have found ice on top of food items on the shelves as well. The ice maker looks like it would be easy to replace based on internet research and your website. I am wondering about the occasional puddle of water on the floor and whether the water inlet valve should also be replaced or if the water from inside the freezer is working it's way to the outside. Based on your opinion I'll order parts to replace the ice maker. Thanks.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Rick, Thank you for the question. When the ice maker is leaking it can cause the puddle you are getting. I suggest replacing the ice maker first as it will need to be replaced to fix the block of ice in the ice cube pan and see if that fixes the issue. You can also remove the backing from the appliance and take a rag, wrap it around the valve and check it after 24 hours to see if it is wet. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Vincent,\n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest figuring out where your leaking is coming from first. If it is coming from below the ice maker tray, then it is likely you will need to replace your ice maker. However if the leaking is happening because the tray is being over filled with water, you should test your water inlet valve with a multi meter to see if it is working correctly. It could be that the solenoid for your ice maker has failed. If your valve is fine, you will  need to replace your ice maker. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "When the ice cubes from my automatic ice maker melt, they release small white flakes of flocculant material that settles to the bottom of the glass.  The cartridge water filter is only 4 months old, and the 'replace filter' light is not illuminated.  The water coming from the chilled water dispenser does not have the white flakes.  Does the water for the ice maker go through the cartridge filter?  Any idea what the problem/source might be for the flakes in the ice cubes?     Thanks.  \\km",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Kim,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The white flakes that are appearing in your ice are caused by calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate which are found in hard water.  Calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate are harmless, but if you want perfect, flake-free ice cubes, you will need to soften your water.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jackie, Thank you for the question. I suggest is checking the water lines going to the ice maker. The lines can freeze and prevent water from flowing through to the ice maker. Also check to make sure all the connectors in the water lines are secure and not damaged. Verify the water supply going to the appliance is open as well. If the water filter has not been changed in 6 months it can prevent water from getting to the ice maker as well. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "It's making ice but also leaking water on bottom of the freezer section to the floor what can cause that",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mitchell,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a number of parts that can cause leaking inside of your appliance. The first part in the list is your water inlet valve, water lines, grommet and tube assembly (which is the part that fills water to your ice maker) if you have the older version and the tube does not have an opening at the top, it could be that your current fill tube is icing up at times and wont let water through when it is being called up. Causing a back leak. I would suggest looking at those parts first. When you search your model number in our system, we will have a symptoms list with the list of parts that usually cause leaking in your appliance. If those three parts are not the culprit, you could consult that symptoms list. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Antonio, \n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest taking a look at your water line first. Make sure it is connected correctly and not broken. If that is all fine and your leaking is coming from your ice maker area, I would suggest taking a look at your fill cup. You may also have to look at your filter housing and filter head as well. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

I would also test the water inlet valve on the ice side to see if it is working. You can test it with a multimeter.  If the water inlet valve has sufficient pressure and is getting power, but the ice maker won’t fill with water to make ice, replace the water inlet valve. Hope this helps!"

You can try to run the following tests.Turn icemaker Off for 15 seconds and turn back on,Push in on paddle 3 times and only 3 times within 15 seconds of powering the icemaker back on.Within 3 minutes, the icemaker should enter the harvest mode.The heater will turn on for a about of 20 seconds, and the comb inside the icemaker will make one full revolution and return to the \"Home\" position.At the end of 3 minutes, the icemaker mold should fill with water.The green light under the ON/OFF switch should be on and steady.If this does not fix the issue you may need to replace the icemaker.

        "customerQuestion": "Ice maker problem - it appears that I'm getting a lot of excess flow. Initially the problem appeared because the grommet popped off the back of the fridge while we were out of town resulting in water being dumped in the floor every time the ice maker thought it needed to cycle. Lots of ice from overflow in the freezer, with the tube that comes through the back wall froze solid.  I got the tube thawed out - also melted the end of it a bit with the hair dryer.  Trimmed about 1/2\" off and thought all would be good.  Now I can see what was really happening - lots of extra water coming in fast enough to splash around and start the ice build up again, which I'm fairly confident resulted in the plugged and the frozen solid inlet tube. Two questions:  Does this sound like i need a new inlet valve?  Will the 1/2 shorter tube with a now imperfect end make any difference as lot as it reaches to the cup?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Lynn, Thank you for the question. This sounds like an issue with a defective water inlet valve. The valve can become \"stuck\" open and allow to much water through. Hope this helps!"

How can i get a replacement and whats the parts # or the name of the motor etc.Thanks jerry",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Gerald,\nThank you for your inquiry.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the ice bucket auger, the dispenser door solenoid, the ice bucket assembly, the motor and the electronic control board.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

In trying to determine the problem, I read the comments on the PartSelect website from other customers and thought I needed either a new valve or a new ice maker. I replaced both because when I took the old ice maker out, it had a lot of mineral deposits in it and looked very unappetizing. The videos on how to replace the valve and ice maker were very helpful. Other customers comments on replacing the valve were also great. The only thing I would add is that after getting the parts installed and the water line and electricity reconnected, it takes an hour or so for the ice maker to to fill. I suppose there is a temperature sensor that won't fill it until gets down to a certain point. I am very pleased with the outcome of this project on our 28 year old refrigerator. Read less"

If the water is slow to the dispenser, and the icemaker wasn't work, then was tinkered with and worked for a bit more the water may not be coming into the icemaker enough to make the ice. I would suggest replacing the Water Inlet Valve Part Number: W10408179 and perhaps the filter, if it hasn't been changed in a while. If the issue continues with the icemaker, we would recommend testing the icemaker to determine if its an issue with the motor module, which is basically like the timer for the icemaker. It calls for ice, allows the water to freeze, activates the dump cycle then calls for more water. I hope this helps!"

I think my husband knocked it loose and then water went all over the insides of the freezer.  I was worried that something inside was broken because I found a bit of water on the floor. I'm sorry to say i have a very dirty water filter that needs replacing. Could a dirty filter cause a water backup problem?  Additionally, the water pan under the refrigerator does not have any water in it, but when I looked in there today, after I had shut off the water supply to the refrigerator, there was something that resembled black dirt in the tray.  I wondered if there would be any sort of rubber or spongy material insulating anything that could have crumbled into the tray from being dry or frayed from age?  Thanks for any direction with this!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Cathy, Thank you for the question. The inlet tube just pushes into place so it may have just been bumped.If you were able to reinsert it and it is working then you will be fine. If the filter needs to be replaced the water flow will be slow or stop and it can cause a leak. The dirt in the tray could just be dirt. The fan helps evaporate the water in the try so it is normal not to see water sitting in the tray.There is no foam or filter in the tray to absorb or insulate. Hope this helps!"

I hope you can tell me whats wrong.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Sybil, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Emitter and Receiver Boards,PartSelect Number PS10064583.To test the board you need to open the freezer door and look at the status LED on the right hand side. Make sure the ice maker control is turned “ON”. The status LED should blink twice, pause, and then repeat,blink blink…. pause, blink blink… pause.Next with the freezer door open, hold down the flapper door on the left side to unblock the optics beam. With the optics unblocked, the LED should light up and stay lit with no blinking. If the status LED continues to blink twice , then you have defective optic boards and they will need to be replaced.If there is no LED light on, then the ice maker could be in “harvest” mode. Hold down the freezer light switch, the status LED should flash every second while in harvest mode. If the LED light still does not flash, then the optic control boards will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!"

The fill cup was filled with frozen water. I filled the ice maker with water (manually) and turned the ice maker back on.  It dispensed ice but when the water cycle came on water spilled  into the freezer because the white fill cup was filled with frozen water.  I removed the ice tray waiting for the fill cup to thaw to see if something may be plugged. How do i troubleshoot a clog that may be somewhere in the water distribution from fill cup to ice tray?  Thank you",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Carl,\n\nThank you for your question. Well there is only the fill cup and then your ice tray. So you would remove your fill cup and run it underneath hot water in your sink to melt the ice that is clogging your fill cup. If it is something in the fill tube that comes up from your water valve, you could try to use a hair dryer to melt any ice that is clogging your fill tube. I hope that helps.

If those two parts are clean then check the ice door kit that is up inside the dispenser section. That is part number W10823377.

        "customerQuestion": "Our icemaker was not making ice.  I ordered a new one from partselect.  While waiting for it to arrive, i noticed that the freezer portion is too cold (-15 to 20 degrees f), and the refrigerator was at 55 degrees.  I found that it was iced up at the bottom of the evaporator not allowing air to flow through the bottom of the freezer, and up into the refrigerator.  (the slide gate is open at the top of the refrigerator allowing cold air to flow in).  I defrosted the unit.  It still is a little warm in the refrigerator ( about 43 degrees versus set point of 37) and the freezer is still -15 to 20 degrees.  I opened up the back panel of the freezer, and check the connections for the defrost thermostat, fan and defrost heater.  All seems normal.  I do not believe the freezer is going through a defrost cycle, but am not sure if just replacing the defrost thermostat will fix the issue of it being continually cold in the freezer.  (it may fix the issue of frost causing low air flow into the refrigerator section causing high temperature in the refrigerator, but will it keep the freezer from getting too cold?  The compressor seems like it is always running when i listen to it.  Maybe a bad temperature sensor for the freezer compartment telling the compressor to stay on continually?  Maybe a circuit board issue?  What do you think?  I hesitate to install the icemaker since there may be other issues.  Time to get rid of this ten year old unit?? thanks.I am a chemical engineer, but may be over my head!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Rory, Thank you for the question,If you have a Multi Meter I suggest testing the Thermistor. The resistance should read at 77 degrees which is 2.7K ohms of resistance. You can also test the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat. Remove it from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced.You can also check for power to the control board and make sure it has the correct amount of volts. Hope this helps!"

If you are able to switch between crushed and cubed on the display panel on the door, we would recommend testing the Crushed/Cubed Ice Solenoid Assembly - 120V 60Hz PartSelect Number: PS8691994 and the Ice Solenoid PartSelect Number: PS8691995 to see if either of these parts are faulty.  These parts facilitate the switch between the two options. If those parts are working, the next step would be to test the micro switches that are up inside the dispenser. If those parts are tested and are function, the issue could be the control board in the dispenser. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Hal, thank you for your question. There are two parts that you should check for this issue. The first part to test would be your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids that control either the dispenser or the ice maker. Even if your dispenser is working the ice maker solenoid may not be and vise versa. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. If that part is testing correctly then you should look into your ice maker being the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If the refrigerator is too warm and it is leaking, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the defrost timer, the evaporator fan motor, the defrost thermostat, the door gasket and the cold control thermostat.  If it is leaking, check to make sure that the drain tube is not clogged with debris as this will sometimes cause water to pool and leak.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      {
        "customerQuestion": "ordered the gasket.\nneed instructions on how to replace it",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Mo, thank you for your question! To replace the gasket, you first need to remove the door of the refrigerator. To remove the door, first, remove the plastic top hinge cover. Hold the door in place while removing the top hinge from the cabinet. Remove the two bolts from the top hinge. Lift the door upwards and pull it up and away from the cabinet until the bottom hinge pin is mounted on the front of the cabinet. Now that the door is on a suitable work surface, you can now exchange that gasket, which is actually mounted to the door and held in place by the inner door panel. It’s kind of sandwiched between that inner door panel and the older door frame. You will need to loosen all the screws around the perimeter of that door. They do not need to be removed; you can just loosen them about a quarter of an inch, and that will allow you to pull the gasket out from beneath the inner door panel. You will note that there is a channel around that inner door panel, and the gasket actually has a bulbous edge on it that will fit up into that channel to hold it properly in place. So just loosen all of those screws all the way around the perimeter of the door. So once you have those screws loosened, you can just pull that gasket out from beneath the inner door liner, and you’ll see a little rib around the edge of that gasket and where it fits into this channel on the inner door panel. So just pull it all the way around and remove it. And once you have all the screws loosened, you can now pull that gasket out from beneath the inner door liner; that’s when you’ll note that little rib around the edge of the gasket and the channel on the edge of the door panel. So just peel that out, all the way around. And use some caution so that you don’t damage that inner door panel. And then you can discard the old gasket, and just lay that new gasket around the door. And because of the type of packaging that gasket arrives in, you will need to either heat it with your clothes dryer, a hair dryer, or soak it in a bathtub in hot water, and that will make it pliable and allow you to work out any of the kinks that may have occurred during shipping. So once you’ve got that softened up and in good shape, you can then begin to install it on the door. Now, we recommend starting in one of the corners and just inspecting that edge of the older door panel first, to make sure that there’s no crud built up there that needs to be removed first. Just start by hooking that corner into position, and work that little rib in under the edge of the inner door panel, and just fit that rib in under that inner door panel, and make sure it’s nice and flush on the outside, and then while holding it in place. Just tighten up that screw a little bit. And then work your way along the door, fitting it in as you go, and then just periodically tighten up on the loose screws to hold it in place. And continue to do that around the door, taking care in the corners to make sure that we have it nice and square and even. And once you have got the gasket fitted in around the door, you can tighten up the screws. So just carefully lift that door, line it up with the bottom hinge, and set it into position. Set the top hinge into the socket and install two bolts. You won’t tighten these bolts yet; you will just put them in all the way, and then you will line up the door before we tighten them up. We hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

It is definitely not coming from the motor area. The drip pattern follows the opening pattern of the door. Can you help?",

If the drip pan has developed mold or grease, it can leak blackened water out.

        "repairInstruction": "It has been my experience that these motors sometimes die when the refrigerator is overfilled and motor strains to keep refrigerator cold. And this motor is used in several models of refrigerators. That said, sometimes the hook-up is slightly different between other units. The available video is good, but like I said, circumstances wil l be slightly different between various models. After cleaning out freezer (plug disconnected first), start to remove outer plastic covers. If you want to keep track of the different steps, you can take pictures with your cellphone. And if there are any connecting wire attachments you think you might not remember, again, you can take a picture, or label with tape (colored tape, or by writing on the tape). And for keeping track of the different-size screws, I place them in a muffin tin, keeping an order of left to right and top to bottom in the tin. When removing Styrofoam blocks in bottom center, make sure you remove any remaining ice underneath in the hole so refrigerator can \"breathe\". Freezer air is moved below to refrigerator compartment, so a blocked vent hole will strain refrigerator as it tries to maintain its temperature setting and can be the cause of your failed motor. After replacing motor onto bracket with grommets and blade, don't completely tighten. Position plastic cover with hole opening over motor and blade assembly. Twirl motor blade to see if there is any interference with cover. If not, take away cover and tighten motor on bracket. If there is any rubbing, adjust motor/blade assembly accordingly before tightening in place. Putting everything back together is in reverse order. Read less"

Once the unit was out, it was a bit difficult removing the top and back panel to gain access to the fan motor (all of that is on top on our fridge). Once I gained access, replacing the fan motor was relatively simple. Although the video on Parts Select showed a model where the fan motor was located in the freezer compartment, the rest of the instructions in the video for changing out the fan motor and splicing the new motor wires to the existing wire harness (different connection) were very helpful. I was glad I purchased new rubber bumpers and grommets and a new compression ring to hold the fan in place. The old rubber grommets were pretty worn. I also took the opportunity to vacuum out all the dust that had accumulated over the years in areas that aren't accessible from the front. The next most difficult part of the repair was maneuvering the unit back into the cabinet. Probably would have been easier if I had a helper. The new fan has been running well and quietly since the repair. Thanks Parts Select! Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "We inherited this dryer three years ago upon purchasing our current house. At that time I found this website to purchase and install a couple of the baffles that were missing. This time, I checked the troubleshooting for my current problem and ordered all of the parts I felt I needed to resolve the problem. Once I received the parts, I followed the great how-to videos by Steve to disassemble the front of the dryer and remove the drum. I could not get to the repairs right away since the interior of the dryer was quite dirty and I took a lot of time to clean it out. Once I got to removing and replacing the drum rollers, idler pulley, rear drum felt shaft, and drum belt, everything went smoothly and was just as easy as Steve described in the videos. If I didn't have such a dirty machine interior, removing the old parts and installing the new parts would have taken less than an hour. I had to hold off on installing the front glide kit and front drum felt seal since I forgot to order two of each (I'll install these at a later date. I proceeded to putting everything back together and testing the dryer. The dryer now runs quietly and works great. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Blower wheel was wobbly about the shaft, producing a lot of vibration and noise.",
        "repairInstruction": "Tools required: Stubby socket wrench, 5/16\" socket, 1/2\" socket, 1/4\" socket, #3 Phillips screwdriver, external circlip pliers, straight slip joint pliers. A decently strong electric screwdriver is highly recommended - Milwaukee 2401-20 M12 cordless 1/4\" Hex Screwdriver, for example.Unplug the dryer. Turn off the gas supply. r />Remove the screws holding the door hinges to the dryer.Remove the door and hinges from the dryer by pulling the door and hinges up, then out.Remove the two plastic thingies (door stops), opposite of where the hinges were, from the front panel of the dryer. Each plastic piece is held in place by two screws.Grasp the front panel by its top edge, pull it toward you, then lift the panel up and off the clips at the bottom.There are a couple metal brackets holding the top of the dryer down to the front shroud (the doorway) and frame, one on either side. Each bracket is held in place by two screws. Remove the screws, remove the brackets, then rock the top panel up and back, like the hood of a car.Remove the screws holding the shroud to the frame. Look carefully. There are two screws that look like they hold the shroud to the frame, but actually do not. Don't remove these screws yet.Remove the screws holding the plastic duct / lint screen slot to the shroud. These are very long.Disconnect the wires from the door switch.Remove the shroud.Remember the two screws I referenced previously, stating they shouldn't yet be removed? Now's the time to remove them. Do so, then set the panel aside, being careful not to damage any wires. Don't lose the rubber gasket sitting around the circular portion of the duct.There's a metal cover over the blower wheel. This cover is held in place by a bunch of screws. Remove them all, then remove the cover.Remove the circlip going around the blower shaft, in front of the blower wheel.Remove the clamp from around the blower wheel and shaft.Pull the blower wheel off the shaft.Install the new blower wheel.Reinstall the clamp around the blower wheel and shaft.Reinstall the circlip.Reinstall the metal blower cover.Make sure the rear of the drum is resting on the wheels.Now things become a little difficult, because you have to fight the drum a little bit. Put the panel containing the moisture sensor, front drum seal, and duct into position. (Be careful not to mess up the drum glides. Make sure the rubber seal at the bottom of the vent is in place, sealing the vent to the blower.) Screw the panel into place with two screws, but don't fully tighten yet.There's a felt seal that is supposed to go between the rear lip of the drum and the rear inside wall. The seal is supposed to be held folded, pinched between the lip and the wall, with the edge of the seal being outside the drum. The seal isn't supposed to jut into the inside of the drum. Use your fingers and some other tool to push the rear felt drum seal out of the inside of the drum. If you use a screwdriver, be careful that you don't cut, rip, or otherwise damage the felt seal.Do the same with the front felt drum seal.Carefully inspect the felt seals. You don't want any portion of the seal somehow working its way back into the inside of the drum. Then verify again that the rubber seal that goes between the blower housing and the vent is in place and properly sealing. Now tighten the screws.Connect the wires to the door switch on the shroud, then loosely screw the shroud in place. Screw the shroud to the vent. Once all the screws are in place, tighten all the screws.Lower the top of the dryer into position.Hook a bracket into one side of the lid, position the bracket over the front shroud, then screw in place.Repeat with the other bracket.Place the front panel onto the bottom clips. Seat the panel onto the clips all the way, then rock the panel forward into place.Install the plastic door stops.Insert the door hinges into their slots, push the door down to seat into place, then install the screws that hold the hinges in place.Plug the dryer in, turn on the gas, test.

Tightening the wheel may result in the breaking of the center hub. If these are not the issues, you may need to check the drive motor, part number PS3500893, to fix the issue. If the drive motor is faulty and is running faster than the normal speed, it may result in the breaking of the wheel. We hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

I followed the instructions on the posted video. My model did not have a removable bottom tray in the freezer so that was one less thing to do. Aside from that the vide o was accurate. I had two minor problems during reinstallation. First, it was very difficult to get the spring clamp back on the fan blade without pushing it against the motor. Recommend you get someone to help hold the spring open while you push it on. Second, the length of wire on the replacement was not exactly the same as the original and I had to move some wires around. Recommend you take a picture of the cable layout before disassembling.

I looked up the part and it is listed as No Longer Available/Discontinued. There is no part substitutions listed.

Once the unit was out, it was a bit difficult removing the top and back panel to gain access to the fan motor (all of that is on top on our fridge). Once I gained access, replacing the fan motor was relatively simple. Although the video on Parts Select showed a model where the fan motor was located in the freezer compartment, the rest of the instructions in the video for changing out the fan motor and splicing the new motor wires to the existing wire harness (different connection) were very helpful. I was glad I purchased new rubber bumpers and grommets and a new compression ring to hold the fan in place. The old rubber grommets were pretty worn. I also took the opportunity to vacuum out all the dust that had accumulated over the years in areas that aren't accessible from the front. The next most difficult part of the repair was maneuvering the unit back into the cabinet. Probably would have been easier if I had a helper. The new fan has been running well and quietly since the repair. Thanks Parts Select! Read less"

My freezer was about 8 years old, and the grommets were worn and compressed, the bumper was not. Replacing these parts DID NOT FIX the problem. I needed a new motor.

It is quite loud.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Richard, Thank you for the question. I suggest checking the fan blades. Make sure they are clean and not bogged down. Make sure the fan is running normal and not slow. In most cases the bang is coming from the condenser fan motor, Part Number: PS1483567. Hope this helps!"

Thank you part #ps1483567",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Richard, Thank you for your inquiry. The fan is designed to operate anytime the compressor is operating, and the compressor runs when the temperature sensor signals that the temperature inside the fridge rises above it's set point, so it will start the cycle to push the air through the fridge and cool it off, so if the condenser fan is running continuously, the fridge may be getting warmer more quickly than normal. Hope this helps!"

If the door rack/shelf is in good condition then you need to replace your end caps. For the left side you will need part 240311501, and for the right side you will need 240311502. Please let us know if you have any further questions."

        "repairInstruction": "I took a look at the web site where I purchased the parts, then I took a look at the paper enclosed with the order. Thankfully, I have a battery operated screw driver since there are so many screws. There are plenty of screws in my refrigerator and freezer doors. I thought that since my old door gaskets were all chewed up looking, if I changed them, the 10 year old air conditioners and the old fashioned light bulbs to instant on energy saver light bulbs, the electric bill would become more manageable. The refrigerator and freezer door gaskets were the first step. They were easy to swap out. You just need to empty the door of all food items, then pull back the old gasket to see the screws. There are alot of them. You should leave 2 loosened screws on each side of the refrigerator door to hold the panel in place while you work and remove the rest. Then you can remove the old gasket and slide the new one into place. Make sure as you tighten the screws and replace the ones you removed, the new gasket fits into the door panel groove securely and is in place as you tighen the screws. Make sure it is in place all the way around the door as you work. You repeat the procedure for the freezer using only one loosened screw on each side to keep the interior panel in place while you work. It takes some time due to the number of screws, but the work is pretty easy. I never even broke a nail. The end caps for the shelf bars just snap into place just as the old ones can be snapped out with a bit of pressure. They do not have to be wrestled and you need to work carefully so that you do not break them. (I ordered an extra just in case, but I didn't need it. I will have it in case I need it in the future)My electric bill dropped from $450 to $110 a month with all the improvements I made. Thank you Part Select for taking the fear of screwing it up, out of the repair process and making it manageable. I can afford my electric bill now. Thanks for your help. Read less"

If all of those parts are fine however, you may have to look at replacing your door gasket. I hope this helps. Good luck with your repair."

Is this normal? I don't want to over tighten it, because the last time i did the repair i did that, and the head snapped off the screw and i had to drill it out, etc.  So, again, the question is: Is it normal for the lower of the two cams (the one that attaches to the fridge) to move back and forth a bit as the door opens and closes?

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Roman,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher does not complete a cycle, open and close the door to see if it is latching properly.  If it is, check the breaker to see if it has tripped.  If the breaker is fine, you may have a failed heating element.  A failed heating element can cause the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle.  You will need to test the heating element with a multimeter.  To test the element, set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch each probe to a terminal. Your reading should be somewhere between zero and infinity, refer to your owner’s manual to determine what reading you should receive for your model. If it is exactly zero or infinity it is defective.  If your test produces a reading different from the manufacturer’s recommendation, you will need a replacement heating element.  I hope this helps.

        "repairInstruction": "Unfortunately, I have still not managed to complete the repair, using the two parts indicated above, nor with the door bracket (part no WP2183805) that I ordered subsequently that arrived two days ago. It is not the same as, nor functionally equivalent to, the old bracket that I assumed was broken, since it was not retaining the piece in the base of the door into which the cam is inserted to mount the door. The new Cam is the correct part, but is not the solution since the old Cam is slightly worn but not damaged, and the thimble I bought does not seem to fit anywhere. The hole in the new bracket has a much too small hole to retain the Cam receptacle piece in place in the base of the door. However, this is the only lower door bracket shown in the PartSelect diagram of all the door parts used on a Whirlpool WRF560SMYM04 refrigerator. I do observe that the dark gray plastic cover on the base of the door is broken, but I don't imagine this plastic cover served to retain the Cam receptacle piece solidly in place, and this plastic cover is not offered as a replacement part either. At present I am at a total loss for how to proceed! However, the instructions for removing and replacing the door are clear and very easily carried out, and the job would be very quick and easy with the right parts. So beware if you are repairing the door on this model that the door parts diagram might not show all the parts to cover the door variations that apparently have been used! Read less"

Which part should I order, the hinge bracket or the cam door in order to fix the problem?  Do these parts comes with instructions on how to assemble them? Another problem with this fridge is that it makes loud noises. It forms ice on the back wall of the freezer drawer, and after some time the fridge stops cooling. I would then unplug it for few hours and restart the fridge. There is some water mess on the floor coming from bottom of the fridge, and then it works fine, cools, and does not make noise. Can you please help me on how to fix these problems?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Javaid,\n\nThanks for your question. You may want to check the hinge brackets and the door cam to make the door level again. The evaporator fan motor likely explains the ice and the noise in your appliance. For the leaking, examine the water reservoir, the water filter, and the water inlet valve for any signs of wear and tear, and replace them if they are damaged.\n\nI hope this helps."

I do not own a socket set and cannot find the specification for the size needed for the screw holding on the door bracket at the bottom.  What is the size needed and how do i determine what part is failing so i purchase just what is needed to repair the problem?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Michael, \n\nThank you for your question. To get size specifications like that you would have to contact the manufacturer. Unfortunately they do not give us that information. However it sounds like your doors may not be level and that is why you are getting a gap. I would suggest first checking to see if your fridge itself is level. If it is, then you will have to take a look at your hinges and your bushings. It is likely that they are either broken, worn out, or unlevel. Good luck with your repair."

I located each area that I would need to make the replacement of parts, by highlighting it on the blueprint. I removed the nut at the dryer light, inside the dryer. Removed the light cover & replaced the bulb, put the cover back on, tighten the nut. I removed all the nuts from the back, remove the exhaust tube, removed the rear panel. I realized that the exhausted tube was kind of heavy. It was extremely clogged with lint so thick , I couldn't see through it & it was also holding water that weighed down the exhaust tube. So disgusting !! I immediately went to my HomeDepot to purchase a new 8' foiled exhaust tube & 2 elbow connectors. Installed it & reused the tightening clamps at each elbow . Wasn't expecting any of this in the plan. I realized that this was probably the culprit of the steamy dryer. I put the rear panel on, without installing the other two parts that I purchased. I put at load of wet laundry in the dry & ran it. The load was completely dry in the first cycle. Problem solved. I would like to say that this website gave me the resources, knowledge & confidence to believe that I could make the repair myself & that was the only reason I moved forward to complete the task. In a sense, this company has saved me,my family & our home from a potential fire. So people of the world please take the time to check your air flow visually inside the exhaust tube .

Then I removed the lightboard and light cover assembly by depressing the latch like retainers for the two wire connectors. Installation was as simple as snapping th e wires into the connectors and then pushing the lightboard and light cover assembly into place. One major note: I learned from a repairman that you cannot resolve the problem by simply replacing the central lightboard. you must replace all three lightboards, the two in the refrigerator and the one in the freezer because unless you can absolutely identify which board is causing the fault, it will continue to cause a problem on the main board and the lights will not work. Replacing the other two boards is the same as the central board. Additional comment to consider: I absolutely fail top see how this design of using three circuit boards for a simple light saves me anything; in fact after only 5 years it has cost me in excess of $400 (or 20% of the original cost of the unit) just in materials for a simple light--absurd, ridiculous design. If it burns out again I will have an appliance repairman install a simple 1950's design switch a small LED bulb which will probably last longer than the unit. Read less"

This board controls both the fridge and freezer lights. You can remove the switch and check to be sure the wires are tight, and replace the switch first if you'd like, and if that doesn't fix the problem, the LED board would have to be replaced.

If the lights are not working in your refrigerator, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.

        "repairInstruction": "Took the rear bottom panel loose , the ice maker and water dipenser valve is in the right corner. Turn off water line to the refrigerator , and also unplug the electric from the outlet. It is easier to take the ground wire loose from the valve bracket now , before taking valve out of the bracket. take the two water lines that run to the d oor and the ice maker loose, then remove the main inlet line. Once you have the water lines off, then you can remove both electrical plugs from the electric coils. The water lines that run to the door and the ice maker cant be confused , because they are two different sizes , so they will only fit the correct side. The electrical plugs are pretty simple as well as, the wires are the same color as the coils, so its fairly easy to see which one goes where. The replacement process is pretty self-explanitary , just reverse the order. Just as a hint of advice , have a sponge or mop ready to clean up the water that comes out of the lines when you remove them. I also changed the drum wheel in the front of the ice bin, this process is not easy if you let the blades and spacers fall apart , as they have to pretty much have to be in correct order , or your ice bin will not crush ice , and you could possibly bust the bin into pieces. The process is not really hard , just pay close attention to what is coming off from where!!! There are two bolt on the bottom of the front cover , take them loose and pull the cover forward from the bottom, then lift a little , should come off. Then the metal front cover should be exposed, ther are two bolts in it as well , remove them , and the front should be loose , this is when you hold the auger and keep an eye on the blades. There is also a nut , right in the center of the wheel you have to take loose , hold the auger then take the nut loose with a 1/2 in. wrench. Once you remove the nut the drum pulls right off the auger. When going back together , make sure the ice crusher blades all line up correctly , as the blades wont work at all . They have to slide back into the blade pivot bracket (slot made into the plastic bucket front). As I said before , be sure and pay close attention , and this process will go easily. The drum is marked front side , or this side out, be sure its installed correctly , as the ice will not feed right. The first cycle of the ice maker making ice will probably be only 1 or 2 cubes , but the second time around you will have a full set of 8 , the water lines get air in them while they are unhooked so you wont get a full cycle the first time.

There was a connector that was easy to separate allowing for the removal of the old unit without cutting any wires. The new unit had a mating connector, which easily connected to the old connector in the refrigerator. After some pushing I was able to install the new unit into the hole in the refrigerator.

Based on our research, a refrigerator door switch controls the on/off function of the interior lights with the opening or closing of the door. It does not have an effect on cooling.

I would recommend testing the Switch,Push Button 6600JB1010A to see if they are faulty. The switch is spring-loaded and is a generally closed type of switch meaning there should be no continuity when the button is pushed, and continuity through the switch when it is no longer engaged. This can be tested with a multimeter. If the switches are tested and are working properly, the issue is probably with the electronic control board in the unit. I hope this helps!"

Due to the age of the fridge I decided to replace them all, especially the sprIngs. I made sure to watch all of the videos for each part. Although they overlapped, each one showed the repair in more detail. The repair was as shown. If your frosge has been in service like mine for many years, plan on taking thw whole ice chute and dispenser door assembly out for thorough cleaning. One trick I learned is to take pictures as I disassemble so I can refer back for reassembly. When I put it together, the microswitch didn't work. I ordered that part, the only one I missed initially and installed it when it came in. Everything worked well. There was no video for the torsion spring and alignment of the chute and frame is tricky, make sure you take a picture. Part Select should dona video foe that. The putty knife trick for the trim ring was key. It was only shown in one video for an internal part so glad I watched them all. Read less"

There is a solenoid part number PS1483583 inside that should actuate and move the bucket arm in order to dispense cubes. Stick your finger in there and to get it to drop down. The solenoid may be damaged, or just frozen in place. Once it drops down leave the freezer door open, actuate the door switch with your finger, while pressing the ice lever in the dispenser. Make sure you have selected cube. If the solenoid is working will go up then back down when you release the lever. If not, then you will need to remove the housing  and see if it is full of frost. The solenoid shaft must move freely in order to work properly. They can also rust with time and prevent the free movement. \n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Robert,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. It actually could be either of those parts. What I would suggest is that you test them with a multi-meter and see if either of them are malfunctioning.

Sometimes it is just a simple break in a piece there that will keep that door from closing properly. If you do not see any physical damage, you can test your solenoid to see if it is broken or not with a multi meter. The price of the part is up above in the part information.

Also, check to see if there is frost build-up, by removing the ice bin.  If the solenoid is rusting, there may be some spillage or splash from the water dispenser.  Try using a thin coat of vegetable oil on the dispenser door to help prevent the door from rusting.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

It seems to freeze up around the end where the blades are and where the rod is in the back.How can i adjust it to make less ice. Please help .",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Glenda, Thank you for your inquiry. I would test your water inlet valve and ice maker for continuity to see if too much water is going to the ice maker. Too much ice buildup can also clog the dispenser flap and make it so that only the crushed ice is getting through and not the bigger cubes. Try taking the bucket out and checking for any obstructions and clearing any trapped ice away. You can test the valve with a multimeter. There are also tests online for your ice maker as well. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Carmen,\nThank you for your question.  If the chute is not closing after the water or ice is dispensed, the issue may be with the actuator or the micro switch.  The actuator is a possible option when ice door won't open or shut properly or when water or is not dispensing. The switch helps control the functions of the dispenser and you may want to test the micro switch with a multimeter to check for electrical continuity, and replace it if it shows no continuity. Also examine the water tank and and the water line connectors for any signs of wear and tear. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi William,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. You can test both of those parts with a multi-meter. Make sure after unplugging your capacitor you release any electrical charge. You can do this with a screwdriver that has an insulated handle. When testing your capacitor set your meter to 1000 ohms. If your meter stays on 0 then your capacitor needs to be replaced. For your start relay, set your meter to the lowest setting and calibrate it to 0. Your relay should be reading anywhere between 10 - 100 ohms. If it does not, then it is likely broken and needs to be replace. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ted, thank you for your question. The run capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature in your fridge and freezer.  Usually if the run capacitor goes bad the unit will not start at all. However, it is possible that it will run too often. In your case, the unit is running too much, which usually means the compressor is being signaled to start more often than it should. So, to determine the faulty part, there are some parts that you will want to check in regards to this issue. The Run Capacitor Part Number: 5304464438,  the Defrost Thermostat Kit Part Number: 5303918214, the Temperature Control Part Number: 241537104 and Temperature Control Thermostat Part Number: 5304496561 and the Adaptive Defrost Control Board Part Number: 5303918476.

It is pretty common with previous customers when the temperature would rise. If you are not able to test the thermostat with a multi meter it is a pretty in expensive part and might be worth installing a new one to see if it fixes the issue. \n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Robert, \nThat is a great question. The Frigidaire refrigerator Error Code SY CE: Communication error during powering up. – This error indicates a problem with wiring to and from the main control board and the user interface board. – Error can also mean the main control board or user interface board (display board) is defective or faulty.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Danny, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat Kit.The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello James,\n\nThanks for your question. Due to the clicking noise, we suspect that the problem would be your compressor. Use a multi-meter to test the compressor for continuity, along with the start relay and run capacitor, and replace any of these parts if they are not showing continuity. Only a licensed technician should replace the compressor if that is the issue.\n\nI hope this helps."

You may need to replace your run capacitor if your refrigerator or freezer section will not start, if they are too warm, or if your refrigerator has become too noisy.  If your ice maker is not working, check the arm to see if it is in the correct position, if you have tried replacing the other parts and nothing worked, you may have to replace the complete ice maker.

Turning the freezer thermostat to its warmest setting then back to cold generated clicks, and after a few tries the compressor started and cooled the refrigerator to its normal cold temperatures. But… later the co mpressor again failed to start, and everything warmed back up again. With persistence and turning the thermostat up and down several times a day, we could keep the fridge cold. It was time to order parts. We needed a new start relay and capacitor for the compressor. For our Amana ARB2214CW a start relay (WP12555902) and capacitor (WP65889-4) were listed on the first page of the Partselect parts list for my refrigerator. I ordered them, received them, removed the old capacitor and start relay (which rattled when shaken). and prepared to install my new parts. The new start relay did not match the old. The old start relay fit my wiring which had a single plug with two small female spade connectors in the plug. The new start relay required wiring with two separate female spade connectors; one the normal size and one larger. Phone calls to Partselect and to Westinghouse shed no light on the discrepancy. On the second page of the Partselect parts list was a combination of a start relay and a capacitor (W10613606) that matched my electrical connector. I could see the connection in the photograph. I ordered it and it fit. Easy peazy. That fixed the compressor start problem. Every time the freezer thermostat clicked on, the compressor started. Success. But… from our troubleshooting we now had a thermometer the freezer, and it was obvious that the temperature difference between the cold point where the thermostat turned the compressor off and the warm point where the thermostat restarted the compressor was much too wide. In addition, the knob was hard to turn and was sticky as it turned. Oiling it fixed the sticky knob problem but not the wide temperature difference problem. I ordered a new freezer thermostat (WP67003000), received it, installed it, and all is now fine with my refrigerator. The new thermostat was physically a little different from the original, but it fit and worked. I returned the first compressor start relay and capacitor and received a refund including the shipping charge. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Dave, thank you for contacting us. If the freezer is staying at its proper temp but the fridge is not, that could be the an issue with the evaporator fan or motor. That is what blows the cool air into the fridge. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Fridge+freezer warm both fans running replaced capacitor and start device. Still compressor not kicking on",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Russ, Thank you for the question. I recommend replacing the Electronic Control Board,PartSelect Number PS11755733.The electronic control board is used in refrigerators to monitor and manage the temperature settings, such as cooling or defrosting times. If your fridge or freezer is too warm, too cold, is not defrosting, will not start, and/or runs too long then replacing the control board could solve your appliance problem.Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Is there an internal fuse or power board  -have power to frige but nothing works",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Gary, Thank you for the question. There is no fuse or board, but I suggest testing the Compressor Start Device and Capacitor PartSelect Number PS8746522 with a multi meter. This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures. Hope this helps!"

At first this happened once in awhile but now it does it somedays more than once a day.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Donna,\nThank you for your question.  If your are hearing a ticking or clicking noise from your appliance, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  You will need to check the compressor start device and capacitor and the high voltage board.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Chloe, Thank you for your question. You would test those parts with a multi meter to determine whether or not they are working. When testing, if either part is not reading 0 ohms, that means they would have to be replaced. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

You can test the Thermistor to see if it is defective.The resistance of the thermistor in the unit should be 2.7K ohms at 77 degrees.Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

        "customerQuestion": "My refrigerator is not getting cold lsd",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Robert, thank you for your question. If the freezer is working but the fridge is getting too warm, you will want to check to see if the evaporator fan motor is working to push cold air to the fridge from the freezer, as well as the damper is opening and closing to allow more or less air in.  You may also want to check that the coils behind the freezer wall are not frosting over, if they are you may need the defrost control board. If the freezer is also too warm and not cooling enough, the start device and capacitor on the compressor. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ronald, thank you for your question. If the noise is coming from inside the fridge when its running we would recommend checking the evaporator fan motor and blade first. If that isn't the issue you may want to check the damper assembly. I hope this helps!"

The first parts to check in this case would be all of your thermostats and thermal fuses. You can test those parts with a multi meter and they should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. If those parts are fine, you should then go on to testing your heating element as well. You can also test that with a multi meter and it should be reading  between 0 - 50 ohms. Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. If those parts are find then you may want to look at your door switch or the timer itself being the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature or grab a glass of ice water to test the thermistor. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced.\n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Amanda, a faulty thermistor can cause this reaction. You can find the thermistor on the freezer evaporator coils. To replace this part, you will need to order it here WR55X10025. Best of luck with this repair!"

Do you know how many are in mine? And can I purchase the same part that many times or is there a different one for each sensor location?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Christina, your model has 3 sensors. To replace all 3, you will need to order 1 WR09X10050, and 2 WR55X10025. Please let us know if you have any further questions!"

        "customerQuestion": "Came home from being out of town for 3 days and everything defrosted and temps in freezer and refrigerator were 72 degrees.   Contacted our appliance repair guy.  It took him quite a while to figure out and believed it was the condensor inverter  and the motherboard (that he said was \"fried\").    He replaced both items (...it took a good part of 2 days...).   it appeared that all was working and both sides of frig were starting to get cold; we had to leave town again.    when we got home 2 days later, both sides were at 72 degrees again.    we called repair guy who was coming the next morning.    when he arrived, all was operating fine, and temps were \"very close\" to their good settings (i.e. freezer @ 0  and  other side @ 35 degrees).     hard to fix something that's working.    we've continued to \"check the temps\" every few hours the past 7 days and all has been ok.   tonight we went to the freezer and everything liquid again (...we haven't put any meat in freezer until we know all ok....).  temps at 45 47 degrees (both sides).   compressor is \"cool to the touch\" (i.e. not running) but fan is running.   i'm thinking that maybe its the temperature sensor(s) causing the problem.       any ideas?   we've already spent $650 on repairs + cost of all food in frig & freezer being lost.   the 36\" GE monogram (counter depth), side by side  is 9 years old.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Diane,\nThank you for your question.  I'm sorry to hear about this.  If the refrigerator and the freezer are too warm than the part that fixes majority of the time is the temperature sensor.  You may want to also check the evaporator fan motor and the condenser fan motor as well to make certain they are working correctly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Mitch, thank you for your question. I would recommend checking to make sure the evaporator motor is working properly, buy turning the fan blade and pushes the air into the fridge and circulates the around around all the items in the fridge. If this motor is working, the next part I would recommend replacing would be the temperature sensor. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Robert, thank you for your question. Your unit may be frosting up on the back coils which can cause the freezer get too warm. I would check the heater and thermostat, as well as the temperature sensor and electronic control board-which has the defrost controls built into it. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Makes ice ok then the ice cubes all freeze together have the temp set to 0 for the freezer",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jack,\nThank you for your inquiry.  It is normal for the ice in the bucket to stick or fuse together. This will occur if the ice is not used right away. This can also occur if the water is splashing or leaking during the fill cycle. Adjusting the water to a lower level may also help. If the load in the freezer is less then half full, it can also cause the temperature during the defrost cycle, to get warmer and may cause the ice to fuse together at a faster rate.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Judi, Thank you for the question. The messages are on the display because the temperature in the freezer is to warm. This is most likely caused by a defective defrost thermostat.You can teat the thermostat,The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "storyTitle": "Defrost terminator (Thermostat) Was Stuck Open, Not Allowing Defrost, Heat Gun or Hair Dryer",
        "repairInstruction": "PURCHASE: Buy the terminator from the site because they sell the terminator (thermostat) separately. Other places have it with the wiring harness for more money. Changing it with the harness attached is a very, very involved project. It includes removing the entire inner liner of the freezer. The one t he site sells requires only a simple crimp splice and shrink tube.TEST- If you have another freezer, ice or a friend's freezer available, it is highly recommended that the new part be tested: You will need an Ohm meter or a continuity tester. You can make one very easily per instructions found on line. TEST RESULTS- a) At room temperature. An Ohm meter should show \"Open\". b) After being in a freezer or submerged in ice water for at least an hour, the Ohm meter should show \"Closed\". I have installed hundreds of defrost thermostats. Very occasionally one is defective. This project is a bit involved, so it is wise to pre-test.HOW TO INSTALL THE DEFROST TERMINATOR (THERMOSTAT):A) Prep Remove Food & Be sure the freezer is warm. Parts need to be pried upon & cold plastic breaks easily. Tip: Put the screws in separate cups with labels. This will make re-installing the many components easier. Gather tools from the attached list.B) Unplug Unit (Turning it off is not sufficient protection against shock.)C) Remove Light Bulb (If it gets broken while working, glass may get in the eyes.)D) Remove Drawers (This is a bottom freezer unit with 2 drawers) 1) ) Upper Drawer: a) Locate the 2 rectangular boxes covering the gears. They are on each side, toward the rear of the drawer. b) With a nylon spudger, push in the 2 clips on each box and lift the boxes 1/4\". They will stop at 1/4\". c) At the front of each track, remove 2 hex head screws with a 5/15\" nut driver or a 1/4\" flat bladed screwdriver. d) Lift the front of the drawer a small amount while pulling drawer. Lifting allows the 2 stops on the drawer to clear the track tabs. e) When near the end of the drawer, lift the gear wheels slightly to clear the track. f) Put the drawer out of the way. 2) Lower Drawer With Front Door *Leaving the door attached makes it easier to align the drawer when reinstalling it later. It must be straight or the gasket will gap. a) Put a thick towel on the floor, in front of the unit, so the door can be laid upon in without scratching the handle or the floor. b) Pull the drawer out and look at each track about 2/3 of the way to the back of the freezer. You will see two long, white tabs. c) Push a tab in while pulling the track slightly forward. Firm pulling is required. Repeat on the other side. d) Drag the towel and door out of the way D) Remove the air grill at the top, rear of the freezer. 1) There is a clip in the center to push with a spudger. It is easy to see in a photo of a replacement fan bracket. 2) On the right side, in the top row of square holes, is another clip to press with a spudger while pulling that side of the grill out. 3) On the left, there is an air chute blocking the clip. It can not be removed. With the right side pulled free, gently wiggle & pull the left side until the clip clears & the grill is free to leave. E) Remove the Ice Maker (Water does not have to be turned off) 1) Loosen, but do not remove, 2 screws above the ice mold. 2) Remove the one lower screw & put it aside. 3) Lift the ice maker & store it out of the way. 4) Do Not turn any wheels by hand, nor bend the bail wire. F) Remove the Thermistor Cover (Upper Right Back Wall) 1) Gently squeeze the sides while pulling. Stop as soon as it's free. 2) Note how the thermistor & wires are installed in the cover & thread the thermistor free. 3) Set the cover aside. G) Remove The back Wall 1) Remove all visible hex head screws. 2) The back wall can now be removed. 3) Set it aside where it will not scratch any surfaces, as the edges are a little sharp H) De-Ice the evaporator with a heat gun or hair dryer. Don't hold the heat source in one spot for long or wire insulation or plastic components will be damaged. I) Note the permanent ice ball in the upper-right corner. The defrost thermostat is under this ball. Melt it with heat. J) Install The New Thermostat Hint- Take the thermostat to a hardware store to buy the correct size shrink tube and crimp sleeves (butt connectors) Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jose, Thank you for the question. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms.

        "repairInstruction": "Our spare 25+ year old Kitchenaid refrigerator (side-by-side model) refused to produce cold air. I could hear mechanical sounds and things \"clicking\", but the temps kept raising. This specific unit only had cooling coils in the freezer, and some ducts that route cold air into the fridge.I emptied the refrigerator completely, removed the ice cube bin and shelves, and left it unplugged for two days with the doors open. Once everything was dry, I plugged the unit back in -- within 8-10 hours, the unit was cold again. Lights worked, and fans in the freezer and back of unit worked. However... once the compressor turned off, it never came back on. This told me that the root cause lies with components that control when to turn off/on the cold flowing into the coils.I looked up my model on PartSelect website, and looked through their \"likely to fail\" list for my model. The defrost thermostat and defrost timer were at the top of the list, and symptoms made sense. Those two parts arrived within a week. The defrost timer was easy to install -- unplug old, plug in new. The defrost thermostat involved cutting existing wires, stripping a small section of sheathing, and attaching the wires to the new part with crimp caps and electrical tape. The electrical tape was there to cover the exposed area of the crimp cap and bundle the wires together. (I used 3M's \"Super 33+\".) Finally, reattach the harness to the socket, and attach the other plugs and grounding clamp.After re-attaching the rest of the required components, I plugged the unit back in. After about 24 hours, it had gone through at least one cycle and was appropriately cold. After letting it churn for another couple days and watching it closely, I felt confident that the problem had been fixed.** Side Notes **Definitely use caution around the fins on the coil. For my unit, the harness plug is directly above the fins, and required some effort to safely remove while not slicing up my hands. Extra long screwdrivers and patience helps a lot. Put a wedge behind the wheels of the refrigerator so that it doesn't back away from you while you work. And, of course, do all this while it is unplugged.** For the PartSelect Website Maintainers **If possible, please provide some better guidance on where to place the lead coming off the defrost timer. The Youtube video was nice, but some clarity on which pole/spade to attach it to (and where to find that info, besides \"consult your manual\") would help many people. Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "My Whirlpool side by side (model #gs6shaxms00) is not staying cool.  Unplug and replug, and it will go for a while, then compressor stops and temp starts climbing in both freezer and fridge.  No ice build up.  All ducts free and clear.  All fans and compressor are running (when it's working).   I replaced relay starter and that didn't seem to do it.  Have a feeling it's either the bi metal defrost thermostat in the freezer or the electronic control board (don't think this unit has a separate cold control switch behind the temp control knob in the fridge? I think that info all gets relayed down the main board?).  Bad thermistor?   Most feedback to the above parts in this site indicate the ecb.  Any insights?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Keith, I suggest testing the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat.The best way to do this is to remove the Thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps"

        "customerQuestion": "Refrigerator is warm, freezer works fine. What parts do. I need",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Angela,\n\nThank you for the question. When the fresh food section is warm you will need to check a few things. You can start by checking for frost build up in the freezer and on the coils on the back of the appliance. If there is frost build up you may need to replace the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat or the Defrost Heater.\n\nIf you do not have a frost build up you need to listen to see if the fan at the back of the freezer is kicking on. The Evaporator Fan circulates air over the refrigerator coils. These coils will convert the heat into cool air, which is then circulated into the fresh food section If the fan is not running then the air will not circulate.\n\nIt is also a good idea to check the gasket around the door. If there are gaps or if it is not sealing properly it will let warm air in. You can turn a flash light on and put it inside the fridge and turn the lights off in the kitchen (evenings are best) and watch for any light coming through around the gasket. \n\nIf everything else checks out you may need to replace the Thermostat. This thermally operated switch, controls the compressor circuit and therefore the temperature of the fresh food compartment.\n\nHope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "My Whirlpool freezer coils get covered in frost and the fridge starts to get warm after the fan can't push cold air (i'm assuming). I have replaced the bi metallic defroster part three times in 6 years. This last time only lasted two weeks before it frosted over again. Any suggestions on something else i might need to replace? This fridge is a complete lemon by the way. If it's still produced i would avoid at all costs.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Steve, thank you for your question. I would recommend checking the defrost heater and Defrost Control Board. The heater and thermostat work in connection with each other to keep the coils defrosted and the control board works like a timing mechanism. I hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "My fridge upper section is getting warm, even when i set it to coldest mode. The freezer works well, is freezing correctly. What could be wrong?  Thank you",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jorge, thank you for your question. The first parts I would check would be the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat Part Number: WPW10225581, Air Diffuser Part Number: WP2209751, Electronic Defrost Control Board with Wire Harness and Screws Part Number: 4388932, Heater, Defrost Part Number WP2323198,  and the Evaporator Fan Motor - 120V 60Hz  Part Number 4389144. If there is frost buildup on the evaporator coils, which are behind the back wall of the freezer section, that is a good indicator that there is an issue with the defrost thermostat, the defrost heater, or the defrost control board. If the evaporator fan motor isn't turning that needs to be replaced, as the fan motor blows cold air into the fridge section from the freezer. If the diffuser isn't opening the cold air is not able to come from the freezer to fridge. I hope this information helps!"

Also the compressor will come on for a short time and turn back off sometimes after more than one try it will stay on and the freezer will go down to -10 or 15 degree f and may work of for several hours. When it is not cooling properly I think the ice maker is also off. I suspect the defrost timer and maybe the thermostat. Is there a thermostat other than the defrost thermostat that controls when the compressor comes on and off. I removed the panel to gain access to the defrost timer and when I tap it with a wooden dowel after the temperature is too high in the freezer the compressor will come on.",

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Pete,\nThank you for your question.  Any amount of ice forming on the evaporator fan motor is not a good thing.  A blockage may cause the ice to build up, but frost or ice could also build up as a result of a faulty evaporator fan motor, a burnt out defrost heater and the electronic control board.

Do i need a thermostat or is it a deeper problem? I’m used to warm air coming out from under the fridge but this one is putting out a pretty v strong flow of cool air. Condenser problem??",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Brenda, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "repairInstruction": "The lower compartment was hovering around 50 degrees. Logic told me that cold air was not being driven from the freezer to the lower compartment. At first, I found the passageway between freezer and lower compartment was blocked with frost/ice, which could have been the entire problem. But why was that ice accumulated there? After def rosting, the problem was only partly solved. A few how-to videos suggested that the defrost timer was a common problem, so I tried that, the part was about $11, with minimal improvement. So I concluded that the fan was not driving cold air from the freezer to the lower section. I tested the fan by removing the freezer back panel completely, wiring the fan to an old ordinary power cord, and plugging that in to a wall outlet. The fan would not start on its own, would only turn if I gave it a spin, and then was very weak - I could stop it with a finger without pain! When my new fan arrived, I again removed the back panel in the freezer and replaced the fan, just a few screws to remove, then swap the fan blade to the new fan motor. The process was simple and obvious. Now the lower section stays near 40 degrees, though I'm not convinced that's the only problem-there seems to be a lot of variation in the temperature. BTW, I had also confirmed the defrost heating element was functional by activating the defrost timer (see youtube), to eliminate that from the diagnosis. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Frank,\n\nThank you for the question, The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the thermostat should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermostat submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced.\n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Tania, we recommend first checking the evaporator coils in the freezer to see if there is ice affecting them. Then we suggest checking the evaporator fan motor to make sure it is running. If the coils are impacted then you are looking at a defrost problem, and the defrost thermostat and defrost heater need testing for continuity. If that check goes well that leaves you with a defrost control issue."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Matthew,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. Yes there is a way. You will have to us a multi-meter to test the defrost thermostat. What you will have to do first is calibrate your multi-meter. Set it all the way to its lowest setting. Then calibrate the needle so that it is set on to zero. After you have disconnected the power to your appliance and taken the part out, take both probes and touch them to the defrost thermostat's terminals. If the needle stays on zero or reads infinite ohms, that means that your part needs to be replaced. Good luck with your repair!"

It will read \"closed\" at room temperature.The defrost thermostat opens at around 150 degrees as it is an overtemp. We would advise testing the sensor on the upper left side of the evaporator for resistance as well. In frost, it should read 42.2k ohms, and would read 5k ohms at room temperature.\n\nI hope this helps."

My timeline: my fridge was not getting cold enough. I realized it the day before going on a trip. I vacuumed the (very dusty) coils at the bottom, and the next morning the fridge seemed colder, but I thought I s hould order parts just in case. I ordered a heater and a thermostat. The fridge seemed to be operating normally when I returned from my trip, but I had the parts, so I thought I'd go ahead and dismantle the freezer and test the existing parts. My intention was to return both parts if the old ones passed the tests. I opened up the back of the freezer and there was no ice on the fins. I thought, great, the existing heater works! I cut out the thermostat, placed it in ice water, and didn't get continuity. So I decided to go ahead and put in the new thermostat. Because I'm not experienced with using a multimeter, I thought I'd test the new thermostat to see how the test should work. To my surprise, the new thermostat also failed the test! Stumped, I thought I might as well install the new thermostat, since I had opened the package and couldn't return it. Further internet research suggests the place-in-ice-water method of testing is not adequate. One YouTube video by Parts Dr says to place the part in a working freezer. I froze my old thermostat and tested it; still no continuity. This thermostat may not be typical, though. The video discussed the temperature ratings on thermostats. The temperature rating on both (old and new) thermostats is L8.9-16.7C. That converts to 48-63 degrees fahrenheit, which obviously are not freezing temperatures. I'm not convinced I needed a new thermostat, but I trusted the videos I consulted earlier. I cleaned the fridge thoroughly, so at least now I have a nice clean fridge to show for my efforts.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Miguel, thank you for your question. I would recommend you remove the rear wall of the freezer compartment to access the defrost drain. It is faster to use a screwdriver and hair dryer by standing the screwdriver up over the frozen drain and heating the screwdriver shaft to thaw the drain. Just blowing the hair dryer is not as effective and will take 15 or 20 minutes longer to accomplish the same thing. Once the drain is clear, pour a cup of hot water through it to clear any residual ice. I like to use a piece of weed eater line about 10 feet long to chase the drain. This ensures that there are no foreign objects in the drain. You should then put about 2 tablespoons of white vinegar in the drain to prevent bacteria from forming. Make sure the area is clear in the freezer so that the hole is not covered, and that the drain tube is not kinked. You may want to replace the tube just to be safe. The part number is PS331122.

I found the parts myself that I needed on PartsSelect.com which arrived with 2 weeks. I watched a YouTube video on how to install the parts. The hardest part was emptying my entire refrigerator of perishables so I could easily get to the malfunctioning fan motor and the motor’s boot. I used a heat gun to dislodge ice clinging to the parts I needed to remove to reach the fan motor. It worked well. Once I was able to detach the old fan motor & its boot, I easily slid the new one into its place. I then reattached everything I had disassembled. It works beautifully without disruptive noise. The water filter cartridge door also easily snapped into place, replacing one with a broke latch. I love the saying,“What one man can, another man can do.”(Except I’m a girl - my husband was amused).

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Randy,\nThank you for your question.  If you have just replaced the evaporator fan motor and the everything in the refrigerator is now frozen, check the temperature settings to see if they are too low.  If the temperature is set correctly, you will need to check the thermistors in the refrigerator to see if they are working correctly.  A thermistor senses the temperature in the refrigerator. You will need to the test the thermistor with a multimeter to see if it has continuity.  Before removing and testing these parts, please unplug the refrigerator from the electrical outlet.  Thermistors will produce different multimeter readings based on their temperature when you test them. The ranges below only apply to thermistors at 32 degrees F. Before testing them, you will need to place the thermistors in ice water for 5 minutes to bring the temperature to 32 degrees F. Set your multimeter to the Rx1 setting and touch the probes to the terminals, you should receive a reading of 16,600 ohms (+/- 5 percent).\nIf you receive a reading outside this range, you will need a replacement thermistor.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

There are some other parts that you will also need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the bi-metal defrost thermostat, the capacitor, the defrost heater, the defrost board, the start device, the cycling thermostat and the light rocker switch.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Out of no where the inside of my refrigerator both freezer and cooler is permitting a chemical over some compare to a nail polish smell. Could this be a evaporated fan failure or something else? By the way, the freezer and cooler are still cooling. The cooler part could be a bit colder but the refrigerator from day one was weak at cooling. This refridgerator is only  a couple years old.  Thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Christine, thank you for your question. That smell is indicative of a Freon leak in the unit. Freon has been can be a very pungent ozone or gasoline smell as well as smelling like nail polish. The amount of Freon contained in the cooling systems of appliances is regulated to be at safe levels, and shouldn't present a threat to your health, but if your sense of scent is sensitive, the Freon smell can be overwhelming. Addressing the issue is as simple as finding the part of the fridge causing the leak. However, leaked Freon needs to be replaced by a technician. In the meantime, open some widows to allow the scent to dissipate. For safety's sake, unplug and scoot the machine out from the wall to gain access to its back or underside, whichever is the location of the coolant tubes that channel Freon throughout the unit. Empty the contents of the fridge and position yourself where the coolant pipes are. In some cases, depending on your model, these pipes are located underneath the unit, at which point you can tilt it back against the wall. Check your fridge's manual for the exact location. The best way to ascertain the location of the leak is to use your nose; wherever the nail polish smell is strongest, it is a sure bet that the leak is nearby. Use a flashlight if need be to find a nick, cut or fraying in one of the hoses. Once you find the leak, use a patch kit designed for repairing cooling hoses. These kits can be purchased at many hardware stores. However, these kits are only meant to serve as a temporary solution; you'll need a professional's advice concerning the extent of the leak and replacing Freon levels. In most states and jurisdictions, it is unlawful (not to mention dangerous) for non-licensed persons to obtain Freon. For this reason, only a licensed repair person should be contacted concerning the leak as well as restoring the appliance's Freon levels to standard levels; if this is not done, your unit won't cool your food to safe temperatures. I hope this helps!"

This part accessed by removing the dial control in the front of the Freezer. Part wasn't exactly the same but worked. I looped the sensor toward the front of the dial. Also replaced the Run Capacitor from the the back of the unit (Very Easy). Replaced the Defrost Timer from the Front of the unit (Easy). Now keeping 35-40 degrees in the Fridge and -15-0 in the Freezer. Nice. I plan to replace the Condenser Fan Motor also as it is a bit noisy. Read less"

It has been working great for about 2 months, today it wasn't cooling properly again and the outsides was real warm. I checked the fan and it wasn't turning, i turned the fan lightly and it started spinning again, what part do i need to check or replace?",

The condensor fan seems to be spinning underneath the fridge. Which part would you consider needing to be replaced?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Chris,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If your refrigerator is not cooling properly, there are a few parts you will need to check.  You will need to check the defrost timer, the condenser fan motor kit, the capacitor, the evaporator fan motor kit, the cold control thermostat, the fresh food door gasket, the start relay cover and the light rocker switch.

        "customerQuestion": "Freezer is working fine but the refrigerator is too warm. Hovering around 55 degrees. The compressor fan seems to be working. Maybe not working as efficiently?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Chris,\n\nThank you for the question. I suggest checking the Door gasket first. Make sure there are no gaps that could let the warm air leak through. In the evening when the room is dark you can put a flash light in the fridge and see if there is any light coming through once the door is closed. If you see light then the gasket will need to be replaced. If the gasket is fine you can check the Evaporator Fan Motor at the back of the freezer. This part pulls air into the evaporator coils and then disperses the air in a continuous motion throughout the refrigerator and freezer.If this is not working then the cold air is not flowing in to the fridge section as it should. It can get build up of dust and dirt over time and sometimes needs a cleaning so the fan it working properly. Since you are back there it sometimes help to vacuum off the coils! \n\nHope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "How do i trouble shoot a condensor fan?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Leo, thank you for your question. If your refrigerator isn't keeping as cool as it should and you feel like the fans are running more than they should you could have a freon problem or a condenser fan motor gone bad. A good way to tell if the condenser fan is not working is to check the area when the compressor is running. If the compressor is running but the fan is not, the fan would need to be replaced.  I hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Our Maytag refrigerator was purchased new some years ago, the ice maker never hooked up, (our mistake) however now, some years later, there is a layer of ice every two weeks at the bottom of the refrigerator that must be hand removed...how can we repair this?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mary,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Based on what you described, the reason why there may be ice building up on the bottom of the refrigerator is the refrigerator is cycling too often, it's leaking water or there is ice buildup in the freezer.  If it is cycling too often then there is probably a build-up of dust on the condenser coils and they will need to be cleaned or the temperature in the refrigerator is set too low.  If it is set too low, you will need to adjust the temperature.  If you have leaking water in your refrigerator you may have a blocked drain caused by food particles or other debris.  Try to flush the drain with warm water through a funnel.  The water tubing may also be clogged and you may have to clean it.  If there is ice buildup in the freezer, it may be caused by leaving the freezer door open allowing the humidity inside to increase.  Try not to leave the freezer door open any longer than it should be.  There may also be an issue with the freezer door gasket and you will need to replace it.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

The run capacitor is usually the first part to test to see if it is not working. The second most common part would be your defrost thermostat.

        "customerQuestion": "My evaporator fan cycles on and off. It tries to start for 2 seconds and shuts off for 2 seconds. When compressor kicks in,it runs on and off. Sometimes it runs on with the compressor and shuts off when the compressor shuts off, only to start write back up and then cycle on and off until the compressor starts up again. This cycling runs for the better part of the day. Very seldom is the fridge in a satisfied resting state. Temperatures in the freezer and fridge are working fine. Thank you. Al",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Al, Thank you for the question. I suggest first checking the wiring from the fan motor. Make sure nothing has come lose or is damaged. With a Ohm meter you can test to see if the fan motor is getting the proper power. If not you may need to replace the Adaptive Defrost Control Board, PartSelect Number PS2582247. This board supplies the board with power. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Debbie, Thank you for the question. The fan will kick on and off to maintain the temperature. I suggest testing the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS11750673. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "The condenser fan is not circulating.  The fan motor is not bound and the bearings are not causing any noise when the fan spins.  If i spin the fan by hand it will start running for about an hour and then turn off and not start up again unless hand started up again.  Is the issue with the fan motor or the controller board?  If so, is this the correct fan model number?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello David, thank you for inquiring. This sounds like an issue with the Condenser Fan Motor. This part PS1957416 is the correct replacement for your model."

However the manufacturer does list it as the one that will work for your appliance. So the harness should install into your current harness. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "My fridge is collins but the freezer side isn't freezing and also not making ice what part do  you ink we need?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Antonieta, thank you for your question. If the freezer isn't freezing the issue is probably with the Run Capacitor Part Number: WP65889-4, Compressor Start Device and Capacitor Part Number: W10613606 or electronic Control Board Part Number: WPW10503278. We would recommend testing the capacitor and start device, as well as the cleaning out the fan and compressor area in case the coils are too dusty, which can cause the freezer to not freeze. I hope this helps!"

        "repairInstruction": "The most difficult part was the removal of the existing fan and shroud. There is very little room to work between the condenser and the coils where the fan is located. The old shroud had to be removed as it was not compatible with the mounting for the new fan motor and blade. Make sure to unplug the refrigerator and give the coils some time to cool down. The first step was to remove the old fan blade... it simply pulls off. Next you need to remove the two bolts holding the fan shroud to the floor of the refrigerator. Then you need to remove the old fan motor from the shroud... unplug the wire connection and remove two small bolts that hold it on. I was lucky to have a VERY small ratchet to get into these tight spaces. Now is the really hard part, removing the metal fan shroud takes a lot of twisting and turning to get it out. The coils have a little play in them, but you must be very careful of the tubing and connections. Also, the coils are very sharp. Once this is out, IF you can get it out....I had my doubts along the way, you can start to put the new parts in... beginning with the new fan shroud which fortunately is made of plastic and has some give which makes it easier to get in. Then you can mount the new motor to the shroud with the three new screws. Plug in the wire connection, add the foam tape to the shroud and mount the shroud to the floor of the frig with the original two bolts. Lastly, attach the fan blade. This replacement kit is well constructed, fits perfectly and contained all the necessary parts (fan motor with wiring connection, mounting screws, wire connection adapter, fan shroud, foam tape and fan blade), but no detailed instructions come with it. I was lucky to get the old fan shroud out without doing any damage to the surrounding parts, but this part was very difficult for a do it yourself person. I would be interested to know if a professional has some other tips for this part of the replacement process. Read less"

Since SY EF indicates an evaporator fan circuit failure and you've already replaced the evaporator fan motor, check wiring between evaporator fan and control board. Check for 12VDC to fan between red and brown wires. Check for variant voltage (depending on high or low speed) between yellow and brown. Test the sensor. You can check these with a multimeter. If error code still exists, replace control board. Hope this helps!"

The red wire is constant 12VDC \nfrom the control board and the yellow wire is voltage that is varied by the Main Control Board in order to change the evaporator fan speed. I hope this helps!"

It was replaced because we kept getting ice build up inside the fridge on the back wall, by the ice maker. For whatever reason they couldn't fix it, and replaced it. All good until recently, i noticed the code 5y ef on the display. I see that it has something to do with the evaporator fan motor. Everything seems to still be working fine. Although it is winter and it is outside in the garage. Still getting the ice build up inside the fridge on the back wall, which i defrost and remove periodically. No ice build up in the freezer compartment. What does the evaporator fan actually do. Do you think turning it off and clearing away ice build up help will resolve the problem.? should we be concerned? should we call a repair man?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ron,\nThank you for your question.  The evaporator fan motor is located in the freezer compartment behind the evaporator cover and is used to circulate the cold air throughout the refrigerator when the compressor is running. If your refrigerator has ice build up, the drain may be clogged with food particles.  This would prevent water from draining and would cause ice to pool and freeze during the regular cooling cycle of the refrigerator.  This issue may be caused by the temperature not being set properly. Make sure you check your owner's manual to make sure the temperature in the refrigerator is set correctly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "I get ice build up around my evap fan. Is this coming from the ice maker or ice maker fill valve possibly. I got an error code 5y ef checked the fan and cleared the ice, reset fridge and everything is working. Problem will come back so any thoughts would help.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Robert,\nThank you for your question.  If there is ice buildup in the freezer, when doors are left partially open, (even a crack), warm moisture laden air is sucked into the refrigerator and then condenses on cold surfaces, such as the evaporator, and everywhere in the freezer. This causes the internal air flow to be restricted and temperatures will rise. Also, if there is ice build-up in the freezer, the drain hole may be clogged with debris and it may need to be cleaned out.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Hi, i just replaced the evaporator motor in my refrigerator because it wasn't cooling.After i replace the old motor my fridge isn't cooling below 55* f and my freezer seems to be working fine. when i replaced the motor i notice that the evaporator coil was frozen is that normal? if not, what can be causing that? my control settings are set at 3* f freezer and 34* f fridge. what can be the cause of my fridge side not cooling below 55.\n\nthank you!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ricardo, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Temperature Sensor, PartSelect Number PS1765215. At 70 degrees the resistance should be 9.3K ohms, 90 degrees would be 7.7K ohms. at 100 degrees would be 6.2K ohms, and 120 degrees would be 4.3K ohms. If the sensor reads outside of range then it needs replaced. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!"

        "customerQuestion": "Not so much a question as help to others. My Frigidaire Professional fridge (FPHB2899PF2) started giving me a warm temperature alert then displayed SY EF (or 5Y EF). Looking into all the discussion online this seemed like an easy fix by replacing the Evaporator Fan motor and calling it a day.  I order the part from PartSelect, it came fast and promptly (Thank you PartSelect). I replaced the motor and even still got the message, SY EF, warm temperature warming. The culprit was low voltage coming from the main board underneath the fridge. After verifying that the Red and Brown wires from the Evaporator Fan harness in the freezer was giving me 11.67V DC and then checked the Main Board voltages for the Evaporator Fan. To check this use the red/white wire on J4B connector and the brown/white wire on J4A connector, if the voltage matched the Evaporator Fan harness, your Main Board is the issue. Basically under 12Volts DC to your Evaporator Fan you will see the SY EF error. I hope this helps at least one person from wasting their time and money on an otherwise easy fix.",

Just checked the fan blade assembly to make sure they were not hitting the fan shroud. Fan blades should sit just partially inside the shroud to make sure it produces maximum airflow. (8) Reconnected the 120 volt AC and waited for the compressor to cycle back on... Nice quite fan... Thanks Read less"

I replaced the fan motor, blade, grommets, i.e. the whole fan train. There were two screws holding the fan which were removed. (After removing the back panel.) Then removed the old blade and dust cap. Detached the wiring harness at the junction. Then reassemble in the reverse order. I screwed up the 1st time...installed the front motor grommet in reverse. Fan blade was not centered. Resulted in a few mins rework. Actually spent more time cleaning all the dust from the compartment and behind the refer than it took to install the new fan system.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Lynda,\n\n\nThank you for your question. Item number 617 are the Fan Grommets that fit on the shaft for the fan blades, it sits between the motor and mounting bracket and also on the metal mounting post on the back of the motor between the motor and rear mounting bracket.They help prevent vibration from the motor against the metal brackets. They are sold separately from the motor so if they are needed for your repair  make sure you add two grommets to the cart as they are also sold individually. \n\nI hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mark,  \n\nThank you for your follow up. The fan at the bottom is the condenser fan motor. It actually helps keep your condenser coils cool while the refrigerator is going through its cooling cycle. Then you have the fan motor in the back of your freezer area, which is the evaporator fan motor. That part helps push the cold air into your freezer and then into your refrigerator area. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "Condenser fan runs all the time what do I do",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Arley, Thank you for the question. A common reason a condenser fan is continually running within a refrigerator is the thermostat, PartSelect Number PS1155320. This sensor takes readings from the refrigerator (and freezer if you have one) and flips the cooling system on when it sees the temperature isn't where it needs to be. You can test the thermostat with a multi meter as well. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Denise and thank you for writing.\nCleaning the coils and the compressor area is always a good idea as dust likes to collect there.

If the cap is chipped along those sides with the two open slots its very possible that has impacted the ability to remove the filter easily.

I hoped that replacing the filter housing would affect the flow problem but it didn't. I then replaced the valve. The replacement part was a little different in design than the original part but wasn't too difficult to figure out. My guess is that the original valve has some kind of electric solenoid that wasn't opening all the way. New value solved the problem. No special tools or techniques were required. Just had to unplug water lines and electrical connectors and figure out the way to plug the new valve in. Read less"

Do I have to replace o-rings or other things? Please advise on this issue!\n2) can the above be performed without having to disconnect the water filter valve?\nCurrently, when water is turned on without the filter inserted in the housing the water pours out onto the kitchen floor. Something is faulty at the connection point between the filter and the housing.\nAppreciate your response.

The new valve has push in connections so you need to cut the ferrules off.. When cutting off the tubing, be sure to cut square. An angled or \"squished\" cut will leak when pushed into the fitting. Attach the valve to the refrigerator with 2 screws and replace the cardboard back and you're finished. While you have the back off is a good time to clean the coils.

        "customerQuestion": "Ice maker works but no water out of front. Took apart and actuator is clicking against the electronic part like its supposed to.  How can i be sure the issue is the inlet valve before i spend $50 on it?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Brian,\nThank you for your question.  To verify if the water inlet valve is causing the issue, you will need to test it with a multimeter.  Before you begin to test your icemaker's water inlet valve, make sure you disconnect the appliance's power supply. The easiest way to do this is to unplug the unit from the wall. Alternatively, you could trip the appropriate switch in the circuit breaker panel, or you could remove the appropriate fuse from your home's fuse box.  Consult with an appliance repair technician if you do not feel you have the skill or the ability to successfully complete this test.  Locate your icemaker's water inlet valve, it is typically located behind a refrigerator. Gently pull your refrigerator away from the wall. You may want to place scraps of carpet, of some other soft material below the fridge to prevent damage to the floor. Turn of the water valve's water supply by closing the shut-off valve in the waterline leading to the water valve. Remove the lower access panel on the back of the refrigerator using a screwdriver or a nut driver.  Place a container under the valve to catch any water that may spill from the water valve and its fill tube. Remove the water valve's fill tubing. Loosen the flare nut on the brass fitting that is found on the inlet side of the water valve. You can use a wrench to loosen the flare nut.  Your water inlet valve is held in place on your refrigerator by means of a metal bracket. Use a screwdriver or a nutdriver to remove the screw that holds the water valve's bracket to the refrigerator cabinet. Gently pull the water valve out of the cabinet, and remove the tube from the outlet port.  There are two wires connecting to the terminals of your water inlet valve. If yours is a double solenoid water valve, it will have four wires. Be sure to label each wire so that you know where to reconnect them later. Firmly grasp the metal connector of the wires in order to remove the wires. You may need to use a pair of needle-nosed pliers. Do not pull on the wires themselves.\nSet your multitester to the R X 1 ohms setting to test for continuity. Place each of the multitester's leads on a terminal. Your multitester should display a reading between 200 and 500 ohms. Closely examine your water inlet valve. The exact ohm resistance rating you should test for may be marked on the valve.  If the test you conduct with your icemaker water inlet valve does not produce these results, then you should replace the component.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

There is also a 12\" wiring harness that led to a simple disconnect. Removing the disconnect and the 3 nuts was easy. However, there was no room to remove the motor with the fan attached. Between frame parts, the drip pan below, the ribs, and small, delicate copper tubing that can't get bent, it wouldn't fit thru any openings. So we rotated the motor inside the framework until the blade faced out, then reached in with a pair of needle nose pliers to remove the washer. Removing the washer is easy, it's just difficult to reach. With the washer off the fan was out of the way and very carefully (it was tight) the motor came out. Reverse was the same issue. Motor tight going in, not a lot of room to maneuver fan onto motor, and needed needle nose to tighten washer again. Make sure you tighten the washer before you install the motor on the prongs. Otherwise you need to remove it from the ribs, twist it to face you, then reinstall it on the prongs. Also, I felt I was stripping the nuts into the new motor. Turns out the holes in the motor aren't tapped. i realized the nuts are self tapping once I looked at them. I'm a big time DIYer and this wasn't bad at all.

        "customerQuestion": "The icemaker makes ice and then cycles through until the icemaker is replenished with water.  Then it turns off - but then it recycles again before ice is made, and refills with water again and again.  Thus, creating a large block of ice. It doesn't appear to be the water valve - but the icemaker itself is not properly cycling after it dispenses ice cubes.  What do you think?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello John, thank you for your question. It sounds like the water valve is working, as its bringing water up to the unit. However, it may be staying open just a bit, and allowing water to slowly accumulate in the icemaker and then you end up with a  block of ice. I would check to see if you can notice any water coming out of the inlet tube, test the valve, and if that is not the issue the only other possibility would be the icemaker itself. I hope this helps!"

Once you have cut that nut from the end of your water line, you can just push the water line into the water valve. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jay,\nThank you for your question.  If you have just replaced your water inlet valve, it can take up to 24 hours for the ice maker to start working.  If it is has been more than 24 hours since the ice maker has been installed, then check the water lines and the water filter to see if there are any clogs.  Also, make sure that the water lines are fitted correctly.  If all of this checks out fine, you will need to check the water inlet valve with a multi-meter to see if it is working.  Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals with the probes. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of 200 to 500 ohms. If you receive any other reading, you need a replacement water inlet valve. We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

Make sure the ice maker control is turned “ON”. The status LED should blink twice, pause, and then repeat,blink blink…. pause, blink blink… pause.Next with the freezer door open, hold down the flapper door on the left side to unblock the optics beam. With the optics unblocked, the LED should light up and stay lit with no blinking. If the status LED continues to blink twice , then you have defective optic boards and they will need to be replaced.If there is no LED light on, then the ice maker could be in “harvest” mode. Hold down the freezer light switch, the status LED should flash every second while in harvest mode. If the LED light still does not flash, then the optic control boards will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "How do you check solenoids on water valve?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Keith, thank you for contacting us. There are two solenoids on the water valve. These solenoids are sometimes referred to as coils. There will be two wires attached to each solenoid. Be sure to label each of the wires so that you are able to properly reconnect them later. These wires are held in place with metal slip on connectors. Grasp firmly on each connector, one at a time, to disconnect the wire from the solenoid. Do not pull directly on the wire, pull from the metal connector.\nSet your multitester to the ohms resistance scale X 1. Place each of the meter's probes to one terminal. Because the reading can vary from brand to brand and from model to model, there is no one reading you should receive. However, if your test produces a reading of infinity, then the solenoid is bad and the water valve should be replaced."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jeffrey, thank you for contacting us. It could be the water valve. There is also a solenoid in the ice maker that controls the flow of water to prevent overflowing. That could be causing the same issue. PS2341896 Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Water dispenses slowly, low volume a's well as low rate of flow. Have replaced water inlet valve but it hasn't resolved the issue. Perhaps a defective replacement valve or could there be another part causing the issue? Ice maker functions properly without any problems and the rate of flow seems to be unrelated to the filter. Ideas?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Casey, thank you for your question. The issue could be a defective valve, however it sounds like it may be an issue with the water filter. Have you changed the water filter lately? If not, it might be a good idea to replace that to see if the flow issues are fixed. If the filter has been replaced recently, try removing the filter and reinstalling it to be sure its locked in tight. If the water flow issue continues, i would recommend replacing the Water Dispenser Fitting and Tube Assembly Part Number: PS886371, the Water Dispenser Arm Part Number: WP2180268 as well as the Levers Retainer/Clip Part Number: WP2194719. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Andre,\n\nThank you for your question. There could be an air pocket inside your water line after replacing the filter. If you can, turn off your ice maker and the back on again and see if that will help it push the air pocket out. You may also want to double check your water inlet valve as well. You have two solenoids on your appliance. One for your water and one for your ice maker.  It could be that the solenoid for your ice maker has failed. You can test that with a multi meter. Good luck with your repair."

The most common part that will fix the issue is the water inlet valve.  Some other parts that you will have to look at as well are the water filter, the levers retainer/clip, the water filter housing, the water dispenser fitting and tube assembly, the strain relief, the filter inlet water tube, the ice door kit, the water filter cap, the water reservoir tubing, the ice dispenser door chute, and the water dispenser lever.

Ice maker, ice dispenser and water dispenser all work fine and i can't see a leak as it is small. It takes a couple days for the bottom of the freezer to fill with water and refreeze. It fills up faster if i am making ice or running filtered water, so my guess is that it is leaking while the unit is calling for water.  It doesn't appear to leak when ice/water are not being dispensed",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jeff,\n\nThank you for your question. The most common parts that cause leaking inside of your freezer are your ice maker and water lines. I would suggest really taking a look at those parts. If it is not that it may be something that you have inside your freezer that is leaking. You could test your thermostat to see if it is working. Perhaps when your freezer is being defrosted, it defrosts too much? If you need more assistance, you may have to contact your manufacturer. Good luck with your repair."

So I went ahead and replaced the valve and after I made sure no leaks were visible I replaced the back cover and continued to observe and all was good.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Tom, thank you for your question. There are two parts that you should check for this issue. The first part to test would be your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids that control either the dispenser or the ice maker. Even if your dispenser is working the ice maker solenoid may not be and vise versa. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. If that part is testing correctly then you should look into your control board being the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "repairInstruction": "Our ice maker had been overfilling and causing a big block of ice in the bin for some time, but it finally stopped working completely. In trying to determine the problem, I read the comments on the PartSelect website from other customers and thought I needed either a new valve or a new ice maker. I replaced both because when I took the old ice maker out, it had a lot of mineral deposits in it and looked very unappetizing. The videos on how to replace the valve and ice maker were very helpful. Other customers comments on replacing the valve were also great. The only thing I would add is that after getting the parts installed and the water line and electricity reconnected, it takes an hour or so for the ice maker to to fill. I suppose there is a temperature sensor that won't fill it until gets down to a certain point. I am very pleased with the outcome of this project on our 28 year old refrigerator. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "I could not determine if the solenoid water inlet valve or the ice maker unit was bad, so I replaced both. In this model of the refrigerator, the freezer is a drawer on the bottom, so this makes access to the ice maker mounting a little tricky. The need to contort to reach into the back made this take longer and was more uncomfort able than expected. I needed to completely remove the screws for the top brackets, even though most instructions indicate you can loosen these and lift the ice maker off. Be careful to properly re-seat the water guide that directs the water from the inlet tube to the ice maker. That tended to interfere with re-connecting the wiring harness to the back of the freezer. Again, this was likely difficult because of having to bend over into the freezer. The ice maker needs to be in the freezer for about 12 hours before the sensor in the black wire is cool enough to allow operation. I did not know this at first, so I was initially worried that there was a bigger problem. If you want to use the test functions with a jumper wire, be sure the door switch that controls the freezer light is depressed. The solenoid value replacement was fairly straightforward. I found it useful to use a small open wrench to push the compression lock for the value-to-ice maker water tube to remove the old solenoid. Otherwise, replacing the water valve was simple. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "Watched the video from whirlpool and it seemed to be relatively straightforward - but as I am afraid of electricity and not much of a DIY guy I had a friend over to supervise - initially diagnosed a leak at the water inlet valve - but after ordering the part online ($75) and before it arrived about 6 days later I started to investigate the valve - initially I could not release the plastic tube from the valve (output to the ice-maker) but I pushed a part or two and managed to release it - when the part arrived I bought 6ft of tubing from a local store who sold it by the foot as opposed to HD who sold a 25ft tube - I also decided to buy new braided stainless steel to go from faucet to the inlet valve ($10) - put together everything when the valve arrived and did not take long to put everything together - time mainly spent after checking leaks - tea towels and small towels around fridge - to my dismay after few days discovered fridge was still leaking at front - so checked a few videos and thought origin of leak must be evaporation tray - so placed a bowl under the overflow on inside at the back of fridge and it seemed to catch the water and no leaks - so I tried to get existing evap. tray out - not easy - clipped into a slot at back of fridge and released that but still struggled to get tray out - eventually forced it out but in doing that I split the tray - so I was not sure that was issue as I had split the tray forcing it out - however looking at the base of fridge where the tray was the surface was v rusty and rust was there on foot of tray - so I assumed that was issue - ordered a new tray ($20 I think) - looking under fridge after I forced out the tray I noticed there were two clips that held the tray in place - but could not see them when tray was in place - so I took some pliers and forced the end of clips up to make it easier to get the new tray in place - so when I received new tray only went in easily - then tested a few days - found a little leak at faucet so tightened the water line nut - so now just testing that water in evap tray does in fact evaporate- so far so good - I'll leave a few more days then attach back cover of fridge and push back fridge to where it should be -I will always wonder if I needed to replace the inlet valve but the experience was worth it as it gives me confidence to attack other jobs - most of my time spent testing for leaks after replacing parts Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Water inlet valve failed to close, flooded kitchen.",
        "repairInstruction": "Only two possible failures can cause this problem. The valve itself could fail electronically/mechanically, or the ice maker controller on the ice maker itself failed to tell the valve to close. To cover all the bases I bought both parts. $196.00 To change the ice maker, three screws, one electrical plug, remove and reinstall face cover p late from old ice maker to new one, and remove and reinstall the metal bar that indicated when the ice bin is full, and tells the controller to stop making ice. It’s on YouTube and takes 10 to 15 minutes to complete the change. To change the inlet valve, there is a little bit more to it then YouTube shows, ESPECIALLY SPECIAL TOOLING I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND. IF YOU DON’T HAVE IT YOU COULD DAMAGE NEW PARTS DURING INSTALLATION. Pull the fridge out, disconnect power and turn off the water. Have towels/ water catch tray/pan handy. Remove screws on the back cover plate as required to access inlet valve. Remove the water inlet line, (mine was 1/4 inch compression fitting, copper tubing.) remove 2 screws that hold valve in place. Pull valve out to full extension of electrical plug. Here is the part that YouTube DOES NOT COVER, take note of how many wires of go to each prong of the connector and its orientation while removing. I’m not a electrician/spark chaser, my guess it is a solenoid/relay type valve, when energized, it will open or close the valve. This is an AC circuit, and I will be honest, I don’t think polarity is a concern, but don’t quote me on that. It’s just easier to take note and put it back the way it was. It worked for 20 plus years, it should to the same if you put it back the way you found it, given you removed and replaced an identical part or a suitable substitute. Depending what valve you receive your water supply line from the valve to the ice maker can vary. It could be a Nylon compression fitting, (which could require additional parts,) or a quick disconnect. That is covered in YouTube, and its exact. Mine was a QD, cut 1/4 inch off nylon tubing and insert, pull back on line to insure security. Done. Very simple. Reconnect electrical plug, IN ITS PROPER ORIENTATION. Reattach valve with two screws. The next step IS NOT COVERED IN YOUTUBE. Before you reinstall cover plate, and push the fridge back, turn on water supply to the valve and perform a leak check. I would recommend applying power and make sure the valve cycles, and the line between the valve and ice maker doesn’t leak. I was good on the line between the valve and ice maker, that did not leak. My copper inlet tubing compression fitting failed at the valve attach point, and required special tooling to repair. A compression fitting to fix a leak you tighten till leak stops. So they say. This fitting was over torqued at one time or another, and leaked, so I spliced in about 6 inches of new copper tubing added a union, and 3 new compression fittings. The bad part, I had to go to hardware store, buy 10 feet of tubing (only needed 6 inches), the B-nuts, and the brass sleeves. To make the new attach point at the valve and new line, since the valve is mostly made of plastic, I used the union to fabricate the new end going to the valve, removed the union and attached the line to the valve. Here is where the special tool comes in, the fitting on the valve, is a very low profile hex head fitting, made of brass which is a soft material, very easy to strip if the wrench slips, and a back up wrench is near impossible to install as a back up with out fouling the B-nut while tightening the fitting. So I ground down a 1/2 or 9/16 open end wrench to fit, (check your fittings size before grinding or buying a wrench, yours could be metric), made it a thin wrench, so I can tighten compression fitting and back up the valve side WITH OUT DAMAGING THE VALVE I just paid 70 bucks for. If you own expensive tools Harbor Freight is your friend for a wrench to grind down or buy a thin wrench. Snap-On makes thin wrenches, but I think they cost more then the valve. Once my splice was installed, I performed another leak check, all was good, I reinstalled, back cover panel, and pushed the fridge back. Since the ice maker was changed, the longest time took was adjusting ice cube size. You have to wait a complete cycle to see what size is dumped, then make the adjustment, and wait another complete cycle to see results. And do that until you get desired results. Those adjustments are on YouTube, and are fairly accurate. I ended up doing more then 1/2 turn at a time. More like 4 complete turns counter clockwise for larger ice. But it works! To change the valve actually takes about 15-20 minutes, very easy, I had complications. My luck, with any kind of plumbing, I make many trips to the hardware store. That is a given and completely unavoidable. Hope this helps. Ron O. Read less"

I then followed some of the suggestions in this Q&A forum: I manually filled the ice tray and the ice maker did make ice as well as added the cubes to the ice bin. I did this a couple of times to confirm that the ice maker was indeed working. I then checked the ohms reading on the water inlet valve and it read approximately 188ohms (I had read that an acceptable range was 200 - 500ohms). Based on this I purchased and installed a new water inlet valve. It has been 2hrs and I am not seeing any water being added to the ice maker. Do I need to give it more time for the ice maker to initiate a harvest cycle? Did shutting off the power during the water inlet valve installation automatically initiate a restart of the ice maker harvest cycle (which I read could take up to 24hrs for ice to be made)?",

Turning off the power to the refrigerator should restart the harvest cycle, but we have also included a link to our video on how to test the valve and ice maker.

The valve has two solenoids that control either the dispenser or the ice maker. Even if your dispenser is working the ice maker solenoid may not be and vise versa. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. If that part is testing correctly then you should look into your ice maker being the issue.

Check to see if there are different parts for your 'series' of model. I made the mistake of missing this and received the wrong parts the first time as Parts Select doesn't hig hlight this! It would be nice if their website checked to see if different parts are available for your model and ask if you checked this important fact. They were very good to replace the wrong part with the right one and refund the amount of the returned part. On my model, the first two digits of the serial number denotes the series number, which means you may need a 'series' specific model part. After getting the correct parts, replacing the damper control solved the temperature control issues and the refrige is actually quieter now (It used to make sounds as the damper opened or closed). My unit used a 'series 10' version and there was no need to purchase the harness, as I just used the old one. Replacing the dual water valve solved the issue with my water dispenser not working. I'm good with hand tools so both of these were easy for me using just basic tools. Read less"

First you need to remove the main water hose from the appliance, next remove black cover on the bottom of the fridge (about 5 screws) so you can disconnect the hoses going into the valve.Push in on the plastic fastener (blue & white) while you pulling on the hose. Do this for each of the hoses. Next disconnect the wires from the valve and unscrew the valve from the back plate. Replace with new valve which comes with brand new fasteners for the hoses and reverse the steps to install the new valve. \n\nGood luck with the repair !"

If the water from your dispenser is dispensing slowly and you have hollow ice cubes, the issue is likely a clogged water filter and it will need to be replaced.

According to our research, at the beginning of the cycle, an electrical signal is sent to a water valve from icemaker to fill the ice mold with water. Firstly, you may need to check the clogging in water tubes. If this is not the issue, then you may need to replace the ice maker assembly, part number PS2121513, to fix the issue.

Now there is a puddle of water in the bottom of the ice bin every time it drops ice and overnight, it freezed into one solid piece of ice. Is there an adjustment on the water inlet valve to keep excess water from  coming into the icemaker every time it dumps ice and refills",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Sandra,\nThank you for your question.  If you have water leaking into the ice maker, a component in the water inlet valve may have failed.  You will need to inspect the water inlet valve visually and you will also need to test it with a multi-meter.  Before you begin any repair, unplug your refrigerator and disconnect the water supply to your refrigerator.  Locate your water inlet valve. It is usually on the rear of the refrigerator, near the bottom. You will need to remove the rear panel to access it. Inspect the valve inlet supply connections for leaks and tighten or replace the connectors. You should also inspect the valve body for any cracks or damage. Check the outlet tubing for cracks or abrasions that may also create a leak and replace any cracked or brittle tubing and connectors. If none of the above appear to be the cause of the leak, remove the water inlet valve from the unit. Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, test your valve for continuity by placing the probes on the valve’s terminals. You should receive a reading of 200 to 500 ohms. If you receive any other reading, you need a replacement water inlet valve. We hope this helps. Thank you and have a great day."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Kevin, thank you for your question, there are a few reasons your ice maker could stop making ice. First, we suggest checking the bail arm is the down position, then check your water line to see if its frozen. Make sure that the filter is in place, and if it has not been changed in more than six months, replace it with a new one. If the lines are not frozen and the filter is new it could be your water inlet valve, part number: PS11755667. We hope this helps! If you need help placing an order, our customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

Do I have to shut the water off manually to stop making ice or is something wrong with lever switch?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Donald, thank you for your question. We recommend checking the ice maker arm. A broken, damaged or detached arm could be the reason behind too much ice being made nonstop. To test the arm, manually lift it up until it locks into position. Turn the freezer back on and see if ice is being made. If so, the problem is likely with the control module, not the arm. We hope this information helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Maria,\n\nThank you for the question. The first thing to check is the fan in the back of the freezer. It is good to make sure this fan is still running so it is blowing the cool air to the fresh food side of the appliance from the freezer. Also make sure the fan blades are clean and the coils on the back of the appliance are clean. They can have dust build up over time so it is a good idea to give them a good vacuuming. \n\nWe also suggest the gasket around the door is properly sealing and not letting in any warm air. \n\nIf all these areas seem ok then you may need to replace the Thermostat.\n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mike, \n\nThank you for your question. It could be your run capacitor. I would actually suggest testing both your run capacitor, your freezer thermistor, and your defrost thermostat first. Those are the more likely parts to be the problem. You can test all three of those with a multi meter to be sure they are working correctly. If they are, then you might have to look into your board being the issue. I hope that helps.

Touch the leads from the multimeter to the corresponding leads on the capacitor.  The red lead to positive and the black lead to the negative.  The meter should start at zero and then moving slowly toward infinity. This means that the capacitor is in working condition. If the meter stays at zero, the capacitor is not charging through the battery of the meter, meaning it is not working. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Chris, thank you for your question. It could be that the capacitor started it and the start relay followed suit as both of those parts work together. However you may need to have a technician come in to look at your compressor and wiring to see if there is any damage. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "My Frigidaire upright freezer stopped working. The electronic control panel lights up and seems to work. It lights up and the temperature control function seems to work. However, i cannot find any information on how to put the freezer in the self diagnostic mode to check for the problem. Is there anyway to determine whether it is a control board or run/start capacitor problem?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jonathan, Thank you for your inquiry. You can test the capacitor with a multimeter, To test a capacitor with a multimeter, you will need to set the meter between 10K and 1m ohms. Touch the leads from the multimeter to the corresponding leads on the capacitor. The red lead to positive and the black lead to the negative. The meter should start at zero and then moving slowly toward infinity. This means that the capacitor is in working condition. If the meter stays at zero, the capacitor is not charging through the battery of the meter, meaning it is not working. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "I have a 2 years old fridgedare freezer, it was running fine until last week, the compressor runs but its weak, how do i know?  Because  i can hear it,,its humming with very little sound, it used to be a louder and its just cooling to around 36 to 38 degree, which is not cold enough to freeze,  like it suppose to, it should have been below 32 degree to freeze, we all know that so my guess is that since it's cooling & compressor is running weak it maybe a run capacitor issue, its just my guess.I need an expert help on this.   thanks,  mr.lee",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Chang, thank you for your question. Yes, if the compressor sounds lower, and isn't running as it used to, the capacitor should be replaced. If that doesn't fix the issue, you can test the overload, thermostat or defrost timer. I hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Freezer not getting cold enough, fridge ok. Compressor runs but your site recommends a new run capacitor (297286803). Can the compressor run with a bad capacitor and not cool the freezer enough?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Eric, Thank you for the question. This part helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. As long as the compressor is kicking on and off as normal, the run capacitor will be fine. I suggest testing the Sensor, PartSelect Number PS1765215. It should read 5K ohms at room temp.

        "customerQuestion": "When i plug my feezer up the lights come on and the fan works but it never tries to freeze?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Justin, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi William,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. You can test both of those parts with a multi-meter. Make sure after unplugging your capacitor you release any electrical charge. You can do this with a screwdriver that has an insulated handle. When testing your capacitor set your meter to 1000 ohms. If your meter stays on 0 then your capacitor needs to be replaced. For your start relay, set your meter to the lowest setting and calibrate it to 0. Your relay should be reading anywhere between 10 - 100 ohms. If it does not, then it is likely broken and needs to be replace. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ted, thank you for your question. The run capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature in your fridge and freezer.  Usually if the run capacitor goes bad the unit will not start at all. However, it is possible that it will run too often. In your case, the unit is running too much, which usually means the compressor is being signaled to start more often than it should. So, to determine the faulty part, there are some parts that you will want to check in regards to this issue. The Run Capacitor Part Number: 5304464438,  the Defrost Thermostat Kit Part Number: 5303918214, the Temperature Control Part Number: 241537104 and Temperature Control Thermostat Part Number: 5304496561 and the Adaptive Defrost Control Board Part Number: 5303918476.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Danny, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat Kit.The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello James,\n\nThanks for your question. Due to the clicking noise, we suspect that the problem would be your compressor. Use a multi-meter to test the compressor for continuity, along with the start relay and run capacitor, and replace any of these parts if they are not showing continuity. Only a licensed technician should replace the compressor if that is the issue.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Claire,\nThank you for your question.  The run capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature in your fridge and freezer. You may need to replace your run capacitor if your refrigerator or freezer section will not start, if they are too warm, or if your refrigerator has become too noisy.  If your ice maker is not working, check the arm to see if it is in the correct position, if you have tried replacing the other parts and nothing worked, you may have to replace the complete ice maker.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Bryan, Thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: thermistor/temperature sensor, condenser fan motor, evaporator fan motor, make sure that the evaporator fan coils are clean as a lot of dust can cause the fridge to overheat and run all the time to keep cool, also check the run capacitor and controller. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If they all test for continuity, then check the control board. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Eddie, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Thermistor, PartSelect Number: PS977306. With a multi meter you can test it at room temp and should have a resistance of 10K ohms at room temp. If leaving in the unit try and put the meter on 200K setting and see if you get a reading.

The Defrost thermostat did not have a satisfactory reading when it was cold or at room temperature, so I replaced it as well.\n\nUnfortunately the fridge still is not cooling.  The coils inside the unit are at room temperature.  I can feel that the the compressor is warm to the touch while running and the fan inside the fridge is spinning just fine.\n\nThe fridge is three of years old, any thoughts on what to try next?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Pavan, thank you for bringing this question to our attention. According to our research, we recommend cleaning the dirt on the condenser coil, and checking the continuity of defrost heater, part number PS426768, or the temperature sensor, part number PS1527511. If the electrical path is present, then check if the compressor, part number PS12364253, is working properly or not. We hope this solves your problem!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Susan, thank you for reaching out. Based on the description that you have provided, we would recommend checking the compressor start relay. The start relay attaches to the compressor and helps start the compressor motor. If the issue remains, then you may need to check the run capacitor, part number PS3408827, to solve the problem. The run capacitor helps keep the compressor motor running. Glad to be of help!"

Where the evaporator fan motor is taking a long time to start you will need to verify if the part is getting any voltage at the part's terminal leads.  You will need to test it with a multimeter.  If there is no voltage reaching the motor there may be a broken wire between the motor and the thermostatic control.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

To test the capacitor, part number PS817298, you may first discharge it, and then follow the instructions below:\n1- You may use either a digital or analog multimeter. If you are using an analog multimeter, rotate the selection dial to the high setting for ohms of resistance.\n2- Now calibrate the meter by pinching the leads together while adjusting the needle to read zero.\n3- When using a digital model, again rotate the dial to the high setting for ohms of resistance.\n4- Touch each of the probes to one terminal.\n5- The meter display should display or deflect towards zero ohms and then return towards infinite resistance if the capacitor is working properly.\nWe hope this information is useful!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jeanette, \n\nThank you for your inquiry. I would suggest testing both your temperature control and your defrost timer to see which of those parts are malfunctioning for you. You can test those parts with a multimeter. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "Freezer too warm (38f). Cleaned the condenser. Good air flow. Fans working, condenser working. Took apart defrost timer to diagnose & clean contacts. That seems ok. Where is the main logic board? I have looked everywhere. This is a built-in so I hope it's not in the back, where I have to disassemble the cabinets to get to it. This is supposed to be front-serviceable. Also, how do you get to the defrost thermostat on this model? Thanks.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ken, Thank you for the question. The Control Board, PartSelect Number PS304236 is located in the dispenser. The Defrost Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS303514 clips onto the Defrost Heater. You can remove the shelving in the Freezer to access the back panel. Once removed it will expose the Heater and Thermostat. We hope this helps!"

I can rotate the defrost timer through a cycle and the evap fan kicks off, then on again as I rotate the timer.  Capacitor most likely for compressor not turning on?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Paul, thank you for asking. According to our research, we would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: start relay, part number PS287824, capacitor, part number PS10065391, and compressor, part number PS3499809. If you need help placing an order for it, please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Mike, thank you for reaching out. According to our understanding, if the capacitor has no continuity, then the issue is most probably with the run capacitor, part number PS10065391. It helps keep the motor running. You may need to replace it to solve the problems. We hope this helps!"

Although they overlapped, each one showed the repair in more detail. The repair was as shown. If your frosge has been in service like mine for many years, plan on taking thw whole ice chute and dispenser door assembly out for thorough cleaning. One trick I learned is to take pictures as I disassemble so I can refer back for reassembly. When I put it together, the microswitch didn't work. I ordered that part, the only one I missed initially and installed it when it came in. Everything worked well. There was no video for the torsion spring and alignment of the chute and frame is tricky, make sure you take a picture. Part Select should dona video foe that. The putty knife trick for the trim ring was key. It was only shown in one video for an internal part so glad I watched them all. Read less"

Although they overlapped, each one showed the repair in more detail. The repair was as shown. If your frosge has been in service like mine for many years, plan on taking thw whole ice chute and dispenser door assembly out for thorough cleaning. One trick I learned is to take pictures as I disassemble so I can refer back for reassembly. When I put it together, the microswitch didn't work. I ordered that part, the only one I missed initially and installed it when it came in. Everything worked well. There was no video for the torsion spring and alignment of the chute and frame is tricky, make sure you take a picture. Part Select should dona video foe that.

There is a solenoid part number PS1483583 inside that should actuate and move the bucket arm in order to dispense cubes. Stick your finger in there and to get it to drop down. The solenoid may be damaged, or just frozen in place. Once it drops down leave the freezer door open, actuate the door switch with your finger, while pressing the ice lever in the dispenser. Make sure you have selected cube. If the solenoid is working will go up then back down when you release the lever. If not, then you will need to remove the housing  and see if it is full of frost. The solenoid shaft must move freely in order to work properly. They can also rust with time and prevent the free movement. \n\nHope this helps!"

Sometimes it is just a simple break in a piece there that will keep that door from closing properly. If you do not see any physical damage, you can test your solenoid to see if it is broken or not with a multi meter. The price of the part is up above in the part information.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Chris,\nThank you for your question.  If the solenoid assembly is freezing or rusting, make sure that the dispenser door is closing and sealing properly.   Also, check to see if there is frost build-up, by removing the ice bin.  If the solenoid is rusting, there may be some spillage or splash from the water dispenser.  Try using a thin coat of vegetable oil on the dispenser door to help prevent the door from rusting.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Russell,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. That could just be the water that is still in the line. I would suggest testing your water inlet valve to see if it is working correctly. Otherwise you might have to look at your water line and see if there is a leak somewhere. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "First ,we are only getting crushed ice and maybe a cube every once in a while. Is it the solenoid or maybe something else.Also our ice makes more ice than we use in any given day. I usually bag it and put it in the deep freeze. It seems to freeze up around the end where the blades are and where the rod is in the back.How can i adjust it to make less ice. Please help .",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Glenda, Thank you for your inquiry. I would test your water inlet valve and ice maker for continuity to see if too much water is going to the ice maker. Too much ice buildup can also clog the dispenser flap and make it so that only the crushed ice is getting through and not the bigger cubes. Try taking the bucket out and checking for any obstructions and clearing any trapped ice away. You can test the valve with a multimeter. There are also tests online for your ice maker as well. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "When water or ice is dispensed the chute does not automatically close",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Carmen,\nThank you for your question.  If the chute is not closing after the water or ice is dispensed, the issue may be with the actuator or the micro switch.  The actuator is a possible option when ice door won't open or shut properly or when water or is not dispensing. The switch helps control the functions of the dispenser and you may want to test the micro switch with a multimeter to check for electrical continuity, and replace it if it shows no continuity. Also examine the water tank and and the water line connectors for any signs of wear and tear. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "repairInstruction": "The disassembly was not as straightforward as it looked because it required more disassemble than just the damper assembly cover. The entire fridge control panel, the water filter, the air filter and damper cover all needed to be removed. Even after removing them, the control panel cover and the damper control cover needed to be separat ed. Thankfully the manuals showed that those two pieces do separate with a double grooved pressure fitting. After carefully taking those two pieces apart I was finally able to get to the damper control cables and disconnect them. The quickest part of the repair was the actual swap of the damper control assembly itself. Reassembly was really fussy and took a long time to get everything lined up just so. Once that repair was completed the fridge works again perfectly!! I was afraid I had gone through all that and would still need to replace the fridge, but it’s been a couple of weeks and it’s still great! The other nagging issue was the water dispenser lever had been abused by my kids for 15 years and was giving up. The replacement was also fussy but absolutely easy. The lever still isn’t perfect so I’m guessing I may need the actual solenoid part at some point but it does work better than before replacing it. Overall, I would do it again and the parts were exact matches and were shipped quickly. Read less"

You should check your Defrost Thermostat, Thermostat Control, and your Evaporator Fan Motor. You can test all three of these parts with a multi-meter.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jagrit, thank you for your question. You do get draining below your appliance. However if you are getting leaking inside of your appliance it might actually be a temperature issue. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Pulled ribbon cable from green circuit card on the cover. Set the cover aside. Removed green circuit card from refigerator (six small screws). Had to unplug two wires to do this. Set this aside. Make sure you remember which connector each wire goes in for re-assembly. I ended up removing the entire assembly, it was easier to work on. There were a couple more screws to remove and then you can carefully pull the entire assembly down and toward you to remove it. This meant removing the water supply line from the dispenser.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Roger,\nThank you for your question.  Here is a repair story from our website that you may reference on how to install the water dispenser actuator, \"1. Took off the outer cover and water drip tray.\n2. Took off the outer circuit board (DID NOT DISCONNECT it)\n3. Disconnected the black paddle holder, but DID NOT DISCONNECT the water tube.\n4. As I did not disconnect the water tube I had to very slightly east it PARTIALLY out.\n5. There are two screws that hold the sides of the paddle legs in. To rempve these screws I used a phillips screwdriver.\n6. After removing these two screws you can remove the broken water actuator.\n7. There is a small plastic aligning tip on the left hand side wher the metal covers sit on the actuator fiengers. NOTE THIS NEEDS TO BE REMOVED as I could not get the left actuator fienger to pop over it. I removed it with a needle nose pliers. After removing the tip the actuator poped right into its slot.\n8. You cannot hold the two screws and the covers so I used a little piece of chewing gum to hold the cover to the screw and the screw to the screwdriver. It worked great.\n9. Then I put the unit back together in reverse order... it functioned better than before.\"  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "repairInstruction": "This built-in model requires complete removal of stainless steel door \"Cover\". A trim piece that covers the screws on the left side of the door requires lowering the refrigerator on to the rolling legs and moving it forward for access. The tipover strap on top of the refrigerator must be removed first. One the door is slowly lowered and t hen pulled out you need to remove the trim piece then remove the screws on the bottom, top, and lft side. Then remove the four screws from the internal side of the dispenser. With assistance slowly pull the entire front cover from the door which gives access to the internal electronic pad. Be very careful with the door cover as the edges are razor sharp stainless steel. Remove the electronic pad (4 socket screws) and move it to provide access to the motor bracket assembly. Remove assembly (2 screws) and replace with new. This includes removing the connector plug which came off easily. The replacement assembly was a new design from the original which appeared to be much better design. This was very simple to replace. Now the hardest part is \"popping\" the front door cover back on the front which is a two person job. I taped the trim attachment strips to the inside of the cover (left and bottom sides had the strip) so the screw holes would line up when the cover is replaced. All four sides must slide on at the same time with a slight advantage to the side with the handle. Note: this can be dangerous because of the sharp edges and very precise fit...a blood donation was required because of an errant hand and the quick snap in popping the door in place. Once its back on, reverse the process of replacing the screws and carefully moving back in to position and raising back up to previous height. I had very little information on how to do this so I did it slowly and deliberately so it took me about two hours. The dispenser now works better then ever and I have had no frost build up....I wish I had done it 4 years ago. Read less"

This happens when food particles or other debris clogs up the drain hose, which can lead to ice buildup and, eventually, water leaking out of the freezer and refrigerator. You will need to flush the drain from inside the freezer with warm water, or you may have to remove the debris by hand.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "How to install ice depenser rubber seal",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Steve, Thank you for your inquiry. Pull off the dispenser drip tray. Remove the screws that hold the dispenser frame in place with a philips screwdriver, then lift up on the frame and unhook it from the three locking tabs on the top. Disconnect the wiring harness that holds it to the dispenser control board behind the frame. Next you would need to remove the assembly that holds the control board and levers. Start by using a nut driver to push the water line up through the hole in the bottom, then use a philips screw driver to remove the three screws. Carefully pull the housing out and unhook the wiring harness by pressing on the locking tab and remove it from the control board.  Now that you have the assembly out, you can flip it over and remove the ice door seal. It is mounted on a frame that is hooked onto the ice actuator arm, flex the arm outward slightly and lift up on the frame so it comes off the pin and do the same thing on the other side. Once you have it released, it should come forward because of the spring. Take the center cap off by twisting it to release it from the locking tabs, then lift it out and set it aside. Now you should be able to pop the seal out. Line up the new seal and push the three little pieces of the ring onto the frame and replace the center cap-the locking tabs need to go underneath the seal. Snap the seal and frame back underneath the actuator arm, making sure that pins are back in the ramps and move the ice arm back and forth to make sure everything moves properly. Then you can put the assembly back into the dispenser, start with putting the water line back through the opening, you may have to tilt the assembly to get it back in place. Carefully rotate the assembly over, reconnect the wiring harness, then lift the assembly back up into place and replace the screws. Re-attach the dispenser cover frame harness to the control board, snap the frame into the three tabs at the top and replace the screws and the drip tray. Hope this helps!"

If that does not take care of the issue, we would suggest checking the Water Filter, part number PS2364646, and the Water Filter Base, part number PS12364175. We hope that helps!"

First you will need to remove the freezer door handle, remove the dispenser drip tray, then remove the dispenser frame by unscrewing the screws at the bottom, then pull up the frame, and remove the ribbon connector on the control board. Remove control board bracket by unscrewing it, then remove the control board to access the tubing behind it by unscrewing the board from the bracket, then disconnect the power plug on the left of the board to access the water tube. You will need to use pliers to pull out the water tube, so you can take the bracket assembly from the dispenser. You will then need to unscrew the two screws behind the bracket to remove the actuator. Press down on the door flapper to remove the actuator. Press down on the door flap to remove the old one and install the new one, and repeat these steps backwards to install everything back where it was. We hope this helps."

One assumes that one is for the main part and the other is for the freezer. Actually, they are both the exact same size. Although the handle is not an exact match to the original it's close enough for a spare, garage fridge. After reading some reviews there were complaints about having to buy two handles and other complaints about the handle breaking more than once so I'm just holding onto the second handle as a spare.When life gives you lemons, make lemonade! Heck, I'm grateful to have my garage Frigidaire! Our <5 year old kitchen GE broke in May and we have been unable to get a suitable replacement. I am writing this on October 27, 2020. Read less"

If all is fine, you need to check the following parts: door closing cam, part number PS11755285, hinge bracket, part number PS11739061, and door gasket, part number PS11755072. If you require assistance to place an order, please contact customer service. We hope that helps!"

His conclusion of leaking refrigerant did not make sense, nor the noting of uneven freezing, so I figured I would take a chance on logic. Th e worst part was unloading the refrig and throwing away a boat load of food. Anyway once I removed the back panel that reveals where the defrost thermostat is I simply followed the wires by disconnecting the old and attaching the new until I got to the last two - brown and orange which actually go behind the defrost heater element and disappear below the fan. I cut both & used the adapter peice did a crimp - done. The timer took 5 minutes. Its working fine and cooling fabulously! I wanted to get past the two week point it is now in its 4th and doing fine. By he way the cams, thanks to your video took 10 minutes. Very satisfied and will recommend DIY because everyone else seems to want to retire on my dime! Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "The cam on the door hinge is worn. The instructions say to remove the door to replace it. But...inspection shows that the bottom hinge support is an external mount, and it appears that if i support the door from the bottom, with something like a stack of books or scrap lumber, i can remove the fasteners, drop out the hinge, replace the cam on the door and hinge, and bolt it back in place. lying on the floor to remove the remove the door section of the cam with a stubby phillips screwdriver seems a lot easier than taking everything out of the fridge, then taking the door off and having to re-allign the top hinge afterward. am i missing something?",

I ordered both intending to replace first one, then the other as needed. With parts in hand, I pulled off the freezer control knob, used a nut driver to remove the two panel securing screws (behind the face, against the inner ceiling) a nd gently dropped the cover down. The control (temp sensor and cold control) is easily accessible as it sits wedged into two slots in the plastic cover. The control must be slightly lifted in order to extract the long sensor that attaches to the control and runs under it and into a plastic sleeve behind the panel (the new control comes with the sensor wrapped in a tight coil and it must be unwound for the install). Removed the three wires noting which color goes where. Used needle-nose pliers to remove the small push-on tabs and removed the control. After starting the new sensor probe into the sleeve re-attached the 3 wires to the new control. Used the original as a model for how to pre-bend the probe for the first 2 inches as it was mildly frustrating to position the unit back correctly. Pushed everything back into place, re-installed the screws and plugged the fridge back in...(you DID unplug it first, right?). Still haven't used the second part (defrost timer), but I expect it to go soon...it is a 17 year old refrigerator, after all. Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "First, the fridge was warm and the freezer was working and was iced in the back. I unplugged it and let it defrost. I took the back off the inside of the freezer to visually check the defrost thermostat. It looked ok. I put the back on again and plugged it in. The light came on in the fridge, but the refrigerator did not start running. Does this mean it is done for and I need a new fridge?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Terri,\n\nThank you for the question. Sounds like you need to replace the Defrost Timer. Defrost timers are part of the defrost circuit in your refrigerator and freezer. This timer cycles the defrost heater on and off. For every eight hours, the appliance timer will cycle for 30 minutes. The defrost heater is what melts the frost buildup on the evaporator coils, and it can prevent your freezer from frosting up. If your timer fails, the heater will not get the energy it needs to run, and frost will continue to build up and can cause the temperature in the fridge to rise. \n\n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Terri,\n\nThank you for the question. You can test the defrost thermostat and the defrost heater with a multi-meter. If they are in working order it is likely that the defrost timer is the faulty.\n\nIt is also a good idea to check the door gasket. When the room is dark, you can put a flash light into the fridge and close the door and see if there is light coming through anywhere around the gasket. \n\nHope this helps!"

You may need to open the door and remove the kick plate grill. Down in the bottom corner on the left side there will be a cover you can remove to expose the timer. \n\nHope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "My refrigerator-freezer is over 20 years old. For the last several days, i have noticed that some water comes out from the screws on the left side of the freezer particularly when i open the freezer widely. Since i cannot find the copy of the manual for this refrigerator-freezer (14.2 cubic feet).  Also, i have noticed that the freezer does not run as often as before and appears to be a bit warm. Please inform me as to what the problem may be or should i start thinking about buying another refrigerator-freezer. Thanks for your help.      Michael",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Michael, thank you for contacting us. The fridge components may just need a good cleaning. The coils at the back of the fridge by the compressor and condenser fan should be clean of all dust or debris. You can also remove the panel in the freezer to make sure the coils in there are not iced up, while you have that off you can make sure the evaporator fan is working properly, as that is what circulates the cool air into the fridge. It could also be as you mentioned, the defrost timer or the thermostat. The thermostat can be tested with a multi-meter. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Chris, Thank you for the question.

        "storyTitle": "Freezer No Longer Cools",
        "repairInstruction": "Our spare 25+ year old Kitchenaid refrigerator (side-by-side model) refused to produce cold air. I could hear mechanical sounds and things \"clicking\", but the temps kept raising. This specific unit only had cooling coils in the freezer, and some ducts that route cold air into the fridge.I emptied the refrigerator completely, removed the ice cube bin and shelves, and left it unplugged for two days with the doors open. Once everything was dry, I plugged the unit back in -- within 8-10 hours, the unit was cold again. Lights worked, and fans in the freezer and back of unit worked. However... once the compressor turned off, it never came back on. This told me that the root cause lies with components that control when to turn off/on the cold flowing into the coils.I looked up my model on PartSelect website, and looked through their \"likely to fail\" list for my model. The defrost thermostat and defrost timer were at the top of the list, and symptoms made sense. Those two parts arrived within a week. The defrost timer was easy to install -- unplug old, plug in new. The defrost thermostat involved cutting existing wires, stripping a small section of sheathing, and attaching the wires to the new part with crimp caps and electrical tape. The electrical tape was there to cover the exposed area of the crimp cap and bundle the wires together. (I used 3M's \"Super 33+\".) Finally, reattach the harness to the socket, and attach the other plugs and grounding clamp.After re-attaching the rest of the required components, I plugged the unit back in. After about 24 hours, it had gone through at least one cycle and was appropriately cold. After letting it churn for another couple days and watching it closely, I felt confident that the problem had been fixed.** Side Notes **Definitely use caution around the fins on the coil. For my unit, the harness plug is directly above the fins, and required some effort to safely remove while not slicing up my hands. Extra long screwdrivers and patience helps a lot. Put a wedge behind the wheels of the refrigerator so that it doesn't back away from you while you work. And, of course, do all this while it is unplugged.** For the PartSelect Website Maintainers **If possible, please provide some better guidance on where to place the lead coming off the defrost timer. The Youtube video was nice, but some clarity on which pole/spade to attach it to (and where to find that info, besides \"consult your manual\") would help many people. Read less"

If you have have already replaced the bi-metal defrost thermostat and the defrost timer, there are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.

We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: the evaporator fan motor, the condenser fan motor, the damper control, the defrost timer, the defrost thermostat, and the cold control thermostat. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jeffrey, Thank you for the question. This sounds like a defective Thermostat Assembly. I suggest testing the Thermostat with a multi meter to check for resistance. You can also test the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat.The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mario,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If your fridge and freezer section are too warm, the majority of the time it is the capacitor that fixes the issue.  Another part you may have to check is the evaporator fan motor.  To verify which part is causing the issue you will need to use a multimeter.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Richard, thank you for your question. We would recommend checking the damper, Damper Control Assembly Part Number: PS11750106, to be sure its opening enough to allow the air into the fridge from the freezer. If the damper and damper motor and opening and closing properly, the issue is probably the electronic board, PartSelect Number PS11755733,  which would have to be replaced. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Michael,\nThank you for your question.  Before removing and testing the defrost timer with a multimeter, unplug the refrigerator from the electrical outlet.  Using a multimeter on the Rx1 setting, with one probe touching the common terminal (it should be labeled \"3\" or \"C\"), touch the other lead to the other three remaining terminals, one at a time. Testing the first pair should produce a reading of zero, or near zero, denoting continuity. The second pair may also result in a reading of zero or near zero. Testing the third pair of terminals should produce a reading of infinity. If you do not receive these readings, you will need a replacement defrost timer. We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

Put old part back in now back to fridge running all the time. Any ideas or thoughts on this issue?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Stephen,\n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest maybe also checking your defrost thermostat as well. Usually when you are having defrosting issues it is because of either the timer or the thermostat. However you may want to also check your run capacitor and your start relay as well. Just to cover all of your bases. You would be able to test all three parts with a multi meter. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Welby, thank you for writing. Doing such with the screw driver is opening and closing the internal contacts inside manually. The first click you hear is the compressor shutting down and the defrost heater coming on.

The freezer is currently empty (except for the ice), which may be part of the problem, but it did this before it was cleaned out. The seal is in good condition (no visible damage). Could this be defrost timer related or another issue?Thank you",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi John,  \n1.Check the freezer light if this is applicable. Confirm that the light turns off when you close the door. \n2.Check the contents of your refrigerator and freezer to ensure it is cooling properly. Insufficient cooling can cause ice to melt and clump together.\nIf the freezer is not cooling properly then it is likely the defrost timer.\nThank you for your question and good luck with your repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Frank,\nThank you for your question.  This would be a preset timer.  The defrost timer is an electro-mechanical timer that operates a set of contacts that control both the compressor circuit as well as the defrost heater circuit. Most timers will activate a defrost cycle every 8-10 hours of compressor run time. This normally occurs about once every day or two. The defrost timer will normally terminate the defrost cycle after 20 to 30 minutes and the compressor and fans will start again. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Using a multimeter, the defrost heater can be checked for 29 ohms, the defrost thermostat is closed at 20 degrees and lower, it opens at 50 degrees, the defrost timer with refrigerator running, should be turning, you can usually see the internal gear turning through a  sight window on the side of it. It can be turned by hand to the defrost cycle and it should send 120v out to the defrost circuit on terminal 2 of the time and it should come out of defrost and back to running the compressor after about 20 min. The Defrost Timer Kit is part PS2167006. We have a video for you to access. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jim, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "Circulating fan works but will not come on.  Wired it direct but the coils freeze up about every 5 days.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mike,\nThank you for your question.  If the coils in your freezer are freezing every couple of days , there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the defrost heater, the defrost thermostat, the timer and the door gasket.  If the door is not sealing correctly, then moisture will get inside the refrigerator and frost will form when it cools.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Mike, Thank you for the question. The timer is part of the Adaptive Defrost Control Board, PartSelect Number PS2004546 located by the condenser at the back of the appliance. If the appliance is still running normally then the Start device and capacitor shoudl be fine. Sounds like the Control Board is defection. I looked up the part and it is listed as No Longer Available/Discontinued. There is no part substitutions listed. My suggestion here would be to call the manufacturer and see if they can provide you with a substitution for these part numbers. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Joe, thank you for contacting us. We have researched the model and would recommend checking the condenser coils and making sure they are clean and free of frost. If the issue remains, the problem might be with the condenser fan motor, part number PS395284, the evaporator fan motor, part number PS11738465, or the compressor kit, part number PS2580804.

I installed the timer and it worked great for about a week until the frost build up on the evaporator became too much again and then the symtoms returned. I then checked the heater elements and found that both were bad PLUS two clips to the elements were corroded. I then ordered the 2 heater elements. There is more than 1 heater element. Make sure you measure the length of each and then use the graph picture with \"Parts Select\" on the new ones before you order. There is about a 2\" in length difference. Also one comes in a kit with thermostat and wires. Wrong for me. I really wanted that unit as I needed the harness for the bad terminals but it was the wrong heaters and it also came with a new thermostat. Luckly I did not order that one but did order a new thermostat to make sure I did not have to go through this ordeal again. When the parts came I had already replaced the terminals and was ready to go when FedX came. Just make sure you check your heaters before just buying the defrost timer as it may keep you from going back to redo your repair. Just doing your home work before ordering may save you much time in your repair. \"PARTS SELECT\" was one day on both orders and I just ordered standard shipping. They are great to do business with.

Remove the timer from its brackets by backing out two retaining screws.\n\nStep 3: Test the defrost timer with a VOM set to the RX1 scale. Clip one probe of the VOM to each defrost timer -- not motor -- wire, and turn the timer control screw shaft until it clicks. If the defrost timer is functioning, the meter will read zero. If the needle jumps, the defrost timer is faulty. Replace it with a new one of the same type.\n\nStep 4: Connect the new defrost timer the same way the old one was connected.\n\n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Khatoon, thank you for your question. We have a customer, Tom from Kansas who wrote in with a very good example of instructions on how this part is installed: \"The repair was very simple. Turn off power to unit. Remove the spill plate, it just pulls out. Then remove the two screws that are seen when the spill plate is pulled out. The cover slides down and comes out. Disconnect the two wires to the operator switch, they just pull off. Take two small screw drivers and gently raise the tabs that latch in the circuit board jack and pull the jack down to remove it. Remove the one screw that secures the circuit board and use a small screw driver to gently raise the tabs that hold the circuit board in place on the bottom side and remove the circuit board. Install the circuit board on the new cover and intall the holding screw. Plug in the jack that connects the circuit board to the unit. The plug in the two wires to the microswitch. Install the cover and install the two holding screws. Slide in the spill plate. Finally install the face plate, it just sticks on and is very easy because the cover is resessed where it is to be installed. In all I think it took me longer to wright this than it did to do the repair. \". I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "I installed my new ice maker by following your video, but it’s been a day and a half and still no ice cubes have been made. I checked the electrical connection and it was fine. I’m at a loss and could use some help.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Greg, thank you for your question. We would recommend testing the icemaker. It is possible the part is defective. It is also imperative that you check the valve to be sure it is opening to allow water to the icemaker. Here is a link for testing the valve. \n\nhttps://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator+test-water-valve+repair.htm\n\nAnd testing instructions for the icemaker. \n\nBehind the cover is a series of electrical test points that can be used to diagnose the ice maker. The unit can be manually operated by inserting an insulated jumper wire into test points “T” and “H” to initiate a “test harvest”. The jumper should be insulated 14 gauge solid wire that has the insulation stripped back about 3/4 of an inch on both ends, and bent into a “U” shape. When inserted into the test points for 5 to 10 seconds, the motor should start and the cycle will continue on its own. You may have to manually close the freezer door switch for this to operate. This test will simulate a real harvest cycle and will operate the ejector blades, shut off arm and the fill valve in the proper sequence, and will allow you to do a proper diagnosis. This is a live voltage test and should only be performed by a qualified person. If the motor does not start, you can verify that you have power to the ice maker at test points “L” and “N”. If the ice maker is getting power and does not perform a cycle, then the icemaker would have to be replaced."

        "customerQuestion": "We have the Frigidaire gallery.  We got sy ce code and the first troubleshoot was to unplug the fridge for 15 minutes.  When plugged back in the code became sy cf.  It has since gone back to sy ce.  I know both are communication errors, but what's the difference?  With both codes, the frige and freezer are working aside from ice and water dispensing and the user interface cannot be changed.  I pulled both the main control board and the user interface board and both have solid connections and neither has any indication of burned or frayed wiring at or around the connections.  How would you check the wiring between the 2 units?  Both the main control board and the user interface board were replaced about 5 yrs ago, is this a common reoccurring issue on this fridge?  Suggestions or solutions? Thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello David, Thank you for your inquiry. You can check the wiring with a voltmeter. The SY CE error code means there is a communications issue. This communication problem is caused by either a wiring issue, wire harness issue, faulty control board, or a bad user interface board. The SY CF error code typically means that your refrigerator has detected an error between the main control board and the user interface (the control on the Freezer door). If the refrigerator is working other than the ice and water dispenser, it is most likely an issue with the user interface board and we would recommend replacing it part# PS3503319. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ryan, thank you for your question. Yes it does, the inverter handles those functions and so your appliance does not have either of those parts. Unfortunately no, you would either need a technician to jimmy something like that up for you or you would have to replace your inverter board as the manufacturer made in your appliance. Good luck with your repair."

        "storyTitle": "Freezer intermittently thawing and refreezing.",
        "repairInstruction": "Local repairman was called. He replaced the condenser fan motor as it had an intermittent noise several days before. Cost of the repair was 252.00. Two days later freezer was thawing again. He then came back again and said it was probably the evaporator fan and would replace it for 339. dollars or the mother board which he would replace f or 500 dollars. He recommended replacing the unit. Since my unit was still in pristine looking condition I decided to do some further research. That is when I found your web site. After reviewing the possible causes on your site I ordered the defrost themostat and and all three thermistors.As a precaution I also ordered the evaporator fan and defrost heater and bracket Assembly. When the parts arrived I disconnected the power to the unit. Removed the shelves and lower pan. Removed the light shield and light bulb. Reovede the two screws holding the evaporator coil cover. This allowed access to the evaporator themostat. I then cut the wires from the old themostat and removed it from the coil. I then stripped the wires on the colored wires and also cut the wires on the new themostat and stripped those. Then using wire nuts I aatached the wires making sure they were properly color coded. Wrapped with electrical tape and attached the new thermostat to the evaporator coil. I then located the evaporator temperature sensor and removed it from the coil and removed the clip and placed it aside for use on the new sensor. I cut the wires and discarded old sensor. Stripped wires on the new sensor after determining the proper length and stripped the wires where the old one was removed and the using in line connectors I first crimped the wires on the new connector and the crimped both wires to the wires previously cut and stripped. Reinstalled the connector to the clip and clipped it back onto the evaporator coil. I then disconnected the wires attached to the defrost heater bracket assembly, located the two screws holding it to unit and removed it from the unit. I did a continuity check on it and it checked ok but was black so I replaced it as a precaution since I already had a new one. Hung the new unit onto the mounting bracket reinstalled the two mounting screws and reattached the two wires. Reinstalled the evaporator cover making sure to reattach the ground wire clip. Reinstalled screws and light cover and all shelves and pan. Reconneceted electrical power. Unit operated fine for a couple of days and then thawed again. I then retraced the steps removing what I had to remove to replace the evaporator fan motor and replaced it per the installation instructions on your site. The unit has now been operating for five days maintaining -8 degrees in the freezer and 37degrees in the refrigerator. I probably could have done a little more trouble shooting at the main board but didn't want to risk damaging that since I already had the parts I thought would fix the problem if it wasn't the main board. I only replaced the one temperature sensor so I will probably return the two I did not use. Thanks for your excellent \"how to\"videos. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "I am going to start by talking about the problems. I woke up one beautiful morning around 4 am and grabbed my breakfast and coffee. I was not happy and realized there was a problem when the milk was almost as warm as the coffee. I was confused because I could hear the compressor running and the freezer was cold. On line directed me the r ight direction but I did not want to believe it. I did eventually confirm the evaporator coils in the freezer were frozen over because the heater was evap coil defrost heater was burnt out (multi-meter). I never realized a refridgerator had a heater, weird. The water dispenser in the freezer door had been freezing up for the past year. I could never find a real problem or solution to fix it. I did not find anything relating the evaporator coils freezing over causing the water line to freeze but thinking about the problem it made sense. The freezer was much cooler than it needed to be to cool the fresh food side. The temp control ensures the freezer is at least a certain temp, it did not limit how cold it would get. The hardest part of the repair was waiting for the part. I installation and reassembly of the freezer was easy. I replaced the cooling fan because the old one looked a little chewed up on the sides. It was not recommended or required. After the repair I was able to feel good airflow in the upper freezer and in the fresh food compartment. I think the fix will effect the temperature, the water line and also should help me get more ice from the ice maker (the freezer ducting feeds cold air to the ice maker area). Good luck. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Don,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. When humid air passes over your coils, that will cause the ice build up. You have changed most of the major parts that I would think you would have to check. I would also suggest checking your gaskets to see if they are sealing correctly. If your gaskets look fine then you will probably have to look into seeing if there is an issue with your main control board. I hope this helps. Good luck with your repair."

I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat.The best way to do this is to remove the Thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

I now have prob with refrigerator not being cold enough over past few days and now the water dispenser not working. I haven't been able to take everything out of the freezer yet to look.

If the refrigerator section is too warm, the defrost heater and bracket is one part you will need to check, but there are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the temperature sensor, the dc condenser fan motor, the compression ring, the evaporator fan blade, the dispenser door assembly or flapper, the fresh food door gasket, the inverter kit with jumpers, the evaporator thermistor clip and the defrost thermostat.

Only the front frame where the 2 doors meet when closed gets warm. What electrical part(s) are located along that separation that would cause such a heating condition?Thanks,",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jean,\nThank you for your question.  If the space between the doors is warmer than normal, there is an issue with air flow over the coils.  You will need to clean the condenser coils. When your condensor coils are clogged up, the heat gets trapped.  This causes your condensor fan to run constantly where it may become damaged or cause it to stop working.  The fan blade may also become damaged.  This extended use can also lead to damage to the fan blade itself like warping or breaks.  If you notice that you no longer hear the fan running, the first thing you will  want to check is that the fan blade is intact and clear of any blockages.  If it seems to be working normally, you’ll need to test that the motor is not damaged, and replace if needed.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

I followed the instructions in the video and removed the back panel with a screwdriver. The coils were completely covered in ice. I let the ice defrost by itself as this is a spare garage refrigerator and I had the time. Once the ice was melted I was able to remove the defrost heater harness with a screwdriver. The tube was black as described by others. Installation of the new heater harness was easy and the wires didn't need splicing because they were long enough. I also replaced the defrost thermostat as well as the sensors since I had the thing apart anyway. I am a 69-yr old woman DIY-er. Videos were very clear and I was able to save at least the cost of just a repair visit before parts and labor. Fridge has been running great for two weeks now. Read less"

Being as I considered myself ''mechanically challenged'' my wife always contacted her favorite appliance repair man. However, he was unavailable, so wife was gearing up to go ahead, bite the bullet, and buy a new fridge. We really didn't want another bill to w orry with so she suggested I try the repair myself. She'd watched the repairman do it the last couple of times and ensured me it would be ''a piece of cake'' plus save us some bucks and put off an added expense at least a little longer. Ordering the part from this site was simple. The fridge did have the old 1 bulb element and the new one was the 2 bulb element so I was afraid I'd have to do some splicing, but lucked out and the wire was easily redirected and reached without any stress or problems to plug into the new part. She watched the install video and was able to talk me through it without any problems. We saved at least $125 install bill, plus put off making a big item purchase a while longer. I hope the new 2 element defroster does a better job and we might just get 10 more years out of 'old faithful'! Read less"

My current freezer has a single element heater and the replacement part i was sent is a dual element heater.  The wiring is slightly different and the kit came with an extension wire to make it work.  I was just looking for a video that shows me the safest way to do that.  The model number for my refrigerator/freezer is tfx20jabgww and i was sent replacement heater part #wr51x10101.Please let me know if there is a video showing that.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Michael, Thank you for the question. I just checked our video again and others on YouTube and they all say refer to the instructions. Here is some info I located.  What you will need to do is remove the wire that used to go to the left side of the old heater (usually the blue wire) and run it over to the right side of the refrigerator. Both the blue and pink wire will be hooked up on the right side of the new heater. In some cases, if the blue wire is not long enough to reach to the other side, it will need to be extended.  Included with the new heater is an extension wire and crimp connector to extend the wire.The new heater should fit in the same place that the old heater went, it can be a tight fit but it will work.

My GE fridge is gss22ufpdww.The icemaker seem to have a flat arm, instead of lifting up to stop making ice and dropping it, it supposedly slides inward horizontally.\nmy question is how on earth is this possible as the ice can drop even on the flat arm as you can imagine.  i have seen your youtube video taking out of the old unit which lifts up, and installing the new. when i paid close attention, the new one is like mine flat plastic arm.\nwhen i use my hand to check mine to see if it works, slide in and out, it does.  spring loaded to stay out and however the ice can push it in is a totatl mystery to me.\ni have seen the ice filling the tray and keeps going and the arms doesn't doa thing.\nso i have to turn off the icemaker.\ni have yet to go through the trouble to see if i place something in front of the arm to hold it in to see if that stops the ice making, the ice from dropping.\nif that be the case which i am almost certain that it would work, this means the design of the arm is wrong.  since it moves easily and i doubt if the spring tension increases as it gets old.\ni like to know if there is something else besides i guess a senseless design?\nhow could that be?\nthanks for any feedback and recommendation.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ali,\nThank you for your question.  The paddle attaches horizontally to the bottom of the ice maker with a spring. Once the bucket fills with ice, pressure is placed on the paddle, raising it and sending a signal to stop ice production. So the paddle is pushed upwards and not in to stop the ice productions.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Brian, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS2350702. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. You can also test the Heater, The heater should have resistance and not open (o-ohms). Hope this helps!"

Here is a link to one of our videos on YouTube that you may use a general reference on how to use one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWC44fHn0As. If the defrost thermostat was not working correctly, then the heater would get hotter.  The reason for this is the thermostat instead of faulting to the open position, would remain closed.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Once the coil freeze up the temp will start to drop and I have to unplug the freezer, let the coil defrost and it will work well until it freezes up again. I would appreciate any help on finding out what could be the problem and my next step. Thanks",

        "repairInstruction": "When I first noticed that my refrigerator coil was iced up, I read a little bit about the defrost cycle of a refrigerator. I decided to try replacing the least expensive parts first. First I tried the defrost themostat, it was a very easy repair. My coil still froze up after a couple of days. Then I learned how to force my fridge into a d efrost mode (on a frigidaire you just click the light button in the fridge 5 times in under 6 seconds). Then I noticed that the defrost heater was not heating up...this repair was more difficult. You have to first remove the two shelves, bin, and tracks. Then you remove the back panel...4 screws. Then you have to take out a couple of screws and drill out one rivet on the drain pan and pull the drain pan out so you can get the defrost heater which snakes up through the coil from the bottom of the coil. Be careful, as the drain pan and coil fins are very sharp, I sliced a couple fingers messing around with these parts. The defrost heater itself is relatively easy to put in once the coil is in the right position (there are videos on youtube on how to do this). After I put in the new heating element, and buttoned everything back up, I was excited to check my work...I forced the fridge into defrost by clicking the light switch 5 times, and the heater still didn't come on! It dawned on me that this problem started about 5 days after a major power outage (hurricane Irene)...When the power came on, it must have surged, and zapped the defrost control board...Long story short, I replaced the control board (about $75.00 from partselect.com) and my problem is fixed...at least I have a 100% brand new defrost system now...Of course it won't be too long until my wife wants another fridge to match her Stainless Steel applicances...oh well, this one will do fine in the garage.

Freezer and frig would cool up and maintain for a week or so but then the frog would go warm and the freezer would be ice cold. SO it was then I knew it was a defrost sequence matter. Thanks to Parts Select and their part to culprit algorithm it provided me the several most likely parts to be at fault. Since not having a voltage tester it was R/R time so I started with defrost timer and then went on from there. So all in told the bill for parts was around $120 still cheaper than a repair service call and obviously buying a new unit. Replacing the parts was simple, the most difficult being the defrost heater element but nothing to throw your hands up. My advice is just stay patient, do plenty of research and tackle it, you will save hundreds of dollars. Living without a frig for several days can be uncomfortable but I was absolutely determined to salvage the frig and save money and it was all worth it. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "Thanks to the very fine posts on this site, and availablity of parts, I didn't have to call in a repair man. Due to the near-10 year age of unit, I first ordered a new fridge for the kitchen and moved the GE to the garage. Let it manually defrost. Figured based upon comments posted here I was dealing with the defrost system problem so o rdered the temperature sensors for top and botton, the defrost thermostat, and the defrost heater. As a wise poster said, if I am going to pull the damn thing apart, I'm going to make sure I have all three parts in case I need a particular one. Do not have the skill or gauges to troubleshoot electrical components. Parts arrived from Parts Select in great time, and excellent packaging protection. Parts Select also has great diagrams of the unit, although I could not find written repair instructions anywhere. At first I was going to wait for the parts to arrive and replace everything, but since there was a dely in getting the new fridge in, and the freezer section of the old fridge worked fine, once I had defrosted the old fridge, and cleaned up a few of the rusted over connections, I put everything back together, to await new fridge and receipt of parts for old fridge. Well, as is the story of my Karmic life, once fridge defrosted, and I put everything back together, plugged old unit in inside garage, everything came back up working perfectly on the recommended settings for both freezer and fridge sections. Has continued to maintain correct temps for over a week now. Also have new fridge. Don't recommend the top freezer Maytag one for about $700, as construction is cheap, and temps fluctuate all over the place. Had Home Depot exchange out for the LG $740 top freezer model, and am really impressed with its construction and performance so far. (Both units are recommended buys by ConsumerRepots.Org) Not sure how long old unit will keep running correctly, nor what caused it to come back to life after the defrost. Perhaps a simple clogged drain tube, or shorted out rusted electrical connections that I cleaned. Anyway, am keeping Part Select parts on hand for possible future breakdown, and enjoying having both fridges running. We needed additional freezer space, and got the peace of mind of a new unit for the kitchen. Read less"

I ordered both the heating element and the heater thermostat (If I am going to take apart the unit I only want to do it once). Both parts arrived very quickly and were exact replacements for the parts in the unit.I removed the ice maker by loosening two screws and unplugging the cable. The top part with the light came down by removing two screws. The vent at the back slid up and was removed. The back panel was removed by removing two screws. I could now access the evaporator coil.The evaporator coil was removed by removing two screws. The old heater element was on the bottom of the evaporator coil and the heater thermostat was on the upper right of the coil.I disconnected the wire at each end of the heater element. I removed the retaining clip at the bottom center of the coil. The heater element was removed by bending a tab at each end of the element and then sliding it down.I unclipped the thermostat from the coil and snaked the wires around the coil to the front so I could work on them easier. I cut the thermostat wires, stripped the ends, connected the new thermostat matching the wire colors, soldered both connections and sealed with some liquid electrical tape. I then snaked the wires behind the coil and snapped the thermostat onto the coil.The heating element slid up into the bottom of the coil and I bent the tabs back into place and reinstalled the retaining clip. I reconnected the wires to the element.Putting everything back together was a few more minutes.Total repair time was about 4 hours from starting to empty the freezer to when I turned the unit back on. By far the longest activity was defrosting. The actual repair itself was about half an hour. Emptying, defrosting and cleaning up were the other 3 and a half hours. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Holly, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your appliance, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. Good luck with your repair."

So not the heater, it has to be this sensor. Please help.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Kyle,\nThank you for your question.  To verify if the thermistor or sensor is causing the issue, you will need to test it with a multi-meter.  Begin by unplugging your refrigerator, then remove the back panel of your refrigerator to locate the main control board.  The thermistor will be connected to the main control board. Remove the thermistor from the appliance in order to test them. Before testing them, you will need to place the thermistor(s) in ice water for 5 minutes in order to bring the temperature to 32 degrees F. The thermistor will produce different readings at different temperatures, and the suggested ranges below only apply to thermistors at a temperature of 32 degrees F. With the probes on the terminals and your multi-meter set to Rx1, you should receive a reading of 16,600 ohms (+/- 5 percent). If you receive a reading outside this range, you will need a replacement temperature sensor or thermistor. There are 2 wire harnesses listed under your model number.  The part numbers for them are PS11731432 and PS8260195.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Steve, thank you for your question! Since you have already replaced the most of the common parts that can cause the issue, there are a few additional things you might want to consider. Make sure there are no obstructions blocking airflow around the evaporator coils. Poor airflow can lead to uneven cooling and frost buildup. Check the door gaskets for any leaks that might be allowing warm air to enter the freezer compartment. Even a small gap in the gasket can lead to frost buildup. Ensure that the refrigerator doors are properly aligned and sealing tightly when closed. Misaligned doors can also lead to warm air entering the freezer compartment. Clean the condenser coils to ensure efficient heat transfer. Dirty coils can cause the compressor to run longer, leading to excessive frost buildup. That the refrigerator and freezer temperatures are set correctly. Improper temperature settings can affect the performance of the defrost system. We hope this solves your problem!"

        "customerQuestion": "6 months ago i replaced the defrost heater & thermostat assy, because it was shorting on the metal fin of the evaporator and the freezer wasn't defrosting. Now the freezer stopped defrosting again but the heater assy looks fine. How do i test the heater for continuity and what resistive value am i supposed to see on the ohm meter? Or do i test for voltage? What sort of test do i perform? According to what i've seen so far, it's either the heater assy, or the adaptive defrost board that causes this problem. What do you think?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Rick,\nThank you for your question.  Before you test the part for continuity, please unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet or turn the circuit breaker off and then remove the heater from the refrigerator.  A continuity test will not work on some defrost heaters, because the ohms reading may be too high to register on a continuity test.  If you have an auto ranging multimeter, set it to the ohms setting.  If you have a manual ranging multimeter, set it to the lowest ohms setting.  Place one of each of the probes on each of the heater's wires or terminals.  You should get an approximate reading of 10 to 150 ohms.  If the display on the meter does not change or if your ohms reading is far off from that then you have a bad heating element.  Where there is a thermostat attached to the heater you will need to make sure that it has cooled down below its closing temperature before doing the ohms test.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "repairInstruction": "The other instructions and the video provided by Parts Direct are pretty good with instructions, but they omit two steps. First, if you have an ice maker, you will need to unplug the connector on the back side of the panel you remove at the back of the refrigerator to access the drain tube. Just unplug it and you can move the removed pa nel to the side without disconnecting any of the water lines. Second, the instructions say to just reconnect the \"bottom end\" of the new p-trap drain to the drain pan at the bottom of the refrigerator. They don't tell you there are two places to connect the new p-trap to the drain pan. The original tube/trough connected to the one at the back of the drain pan on the left (viewed from the rear of the refrigerator). At first, it looks like the new p-trap won't reach to it for the connection, but if you look closer, there is another connector to the right of the original one that the p-trap connects to properly. Replacing the drain trough with the new p-trap was actually pretty easy and would only take about a half hour. Add another half hour to give the refrigerator coils a good cleaning as they will need it now that you can reach them. The real time consumer, 3 to 4 hours, is needed to use a hair dryer to melt and clear the ice from the condenser at the back of the freezer so the water can drain. Just take your time and all the ice will eventually melt and drain out so the new p-trap will work properly. Read less"

The p-trap drain tube kit may also be known as the duck bill, or the drain pipe. The function of the p-trap drain kit is to carry the water that has formed during the defrost cycle to the bottom of the refrigerator, where your drain pan is located. \n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Philip, thank you for your question. It could if that is what the issue is. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

In comparing both drains on line they seem identical.Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n thanks,\n  ed",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ed,\nThank you for your question.  The part number listed under your model number for the drain tube kit is PS8691807.  If the there is ice buildup at the drain tube, there is likely debris in it preventing water from draining.  The water will pool on the floor and then freeze. The drain tube will need to be either cleaned out or if it is damaged, it will need to be replaced. To place an order for the part you may order it either online, by visiting our live chat sessions, Monday to Friday from 8AM to 4PM EST, or by calling our customer service line at 1-888-738-4871 and anyone will be happy to assist you.

The appliance is 10 years old. Thank you.",

Sometimes dehumidification of leaking warm air can cause the issue of ice build-up and leaking. It also looks like your refrigerator is not defrosting properly. We would recommend checking the defrost thermostat, part number PS11743535, and the defrost heater, part number PS11738606. Please also ensure that the drip pan, part number PS11756973, is not damaged and is placed correctly. Please reach out to customer service if you need help placing an order. Glad to be of help!"

        "customerQuestion": "WE HAVE ICE BUILD-UP IN THE BOTTOM OF THE FREEZER WHAT WOULD CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Rosa, thank you for reaching out. We have researched your model number and found that most of the time ice builds up in the freezer's bottom section if the door is not properly closed and the cool air in the freezer can combine with the warm and humid air from the outside. If the doors do not close properly, ensure that the door seal on the edge of the door is attached properly. If the door gasket doesn’t close properly, ice can build up in your freezer. The gasket needs to be cleaned regularly to avoid ice build-up. Sometimes the drain in your freezer can get blocked or frozen, which will cause an excess of water at the bottom of your freezer, which will turn into ice. You can unblock the drain by pouring hot water down it. Please submit a new question if you have any follow-ups."

So far no freezing up and working as originally. The valve kit came with all the parts I needed to replace and reconnect the plastic and copper tubing connections. Very pleased with the outcome after a week as well as the videos and complests parts needed. The fill tube didn’t need shorthing and was used as it came. Adding, easy to replace and connect to the water supply line. My refrigerator location made the repair a little difficult ( small kitchen) but with patience it all went well. Not as difficult if access to the back side is easier. Not the fault of the parts supplied! Also to mention, I vacuumed out 20 years of dust from the coils while I had the back off.

The second thing that I would suggest you look into is your water inlet valve. Test both of the solenoids on that part with a multi-meter to see if they are working correctly.

Once I replaced the water inlet value, water continued to leak from top connection of the hose into the ice water fill tube and at bottom connection into the dual water inlet value. I discovered by reading back through PartSelect's troubleshooting and answers that the problem might be the ice water fill tube. Once I removed it (2 screws and some tugging) it came right out. I saw that it was frozen solid with a plug of ice restricting water from filling the ice maker. I used my wife's hair dryer to melt the ice plug and reattach. Within 30 minutes we had our initial batch of ice. I did in the end have to replace the water line between the water inlet value and the ice maker to get the water leak repaired. I've returned the water inlet value to PartSelect for credit. Great Job PartSelect from a satisfied customer Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "Remove the cardboard back cover and the vertical metal strip, all the screws are the same on the back. Remove the front bottom cover, those screws are all the same but longer. The tubing is bad because they tucked it in on the side and it rubbed and wore a hole in it. Remove the tubing nut. You may notice that there is an insert in the tu bing, but the new tubing has no insert because it is thicker walled and does not the insert because it is stronger. The nut and compression ring are one piece. Open the front door and pull the tube out of the metal plate to the left, and cut the tube off at the end to remove the metal ring, and to make it easier to pull it out. Pull the tube out from the back, but first carefully remove the sticky gray putty, and put it aside. You might also bend the copper line to the right a little if it is putting pressure on the tube at the top of the unit. Now pull the tubing out, and use it to make the new tube the proper length, You might also want to first tape the new tube to the old tube to fish it through. I did not. It was tricky fishing the tube in from the back of the unit to the resevoir. If you do it my way, then aim it to the right. I got it on the second try and felt lucky. Once you get the tube in there, put the metal ring back on the new tube, and press it into the metal plate to the right. You can feel the groove and hole in the metal plate. I think the metal ring goes under the plate, but honestly I don't think you need the ring on the new tube because it has a thicker wall and is stiffer, so it won't pop out. Make sure you put the putty back in once you have completely installed the tubing. I think this is important to keep the tubing from sweating and to help keep the ice bin cold, like insulation. Do not put the tubing back along the left side of the unit, or you will be replacing it again, but maybe not with the thicker walled tubing. When you are all done, check to make sure your sump pump works by pouring water into the ice tub, if it is plugged in and you do not hear the pump, or the water backs up, then your pump may be bad. I also pulled a piece of white plastic out of the clear tubing just above the pump and never did find where that came from, but it would have been from the ice bin. I then ran a cleaning cycle and the instructions say if there was water still in the resevoir, then do another cleaning. My resevoir was full, so I did another cleaning. IF YOUR RESEVOIR IS FULL, THEN YOU NEED A NEW UPPER PUMP! Mine is on order. Mine was full after both cleanings, and after trying to make ice, I realized what the problem was. It could be that it is very clogged, but they don't appear to be serviceable, and I never heard it try to run. I did hear the lower pump, compressor, and fan all run previously, so I hope that when the new pump is installed, the unit is not low on refrigerant or anything like that. Fingers crossed, and good luck. Read less"

If it is good you can see if the water lines have froze over causing a blockage and preventing the water to flow properly and dribble tot he ice bin opposed tot he ice maker. You can also check the water pressure to the appliance. If the water pressure is good you may need to replace the Water Inlet Valve PartSelect Number PS7784017. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Robert, thank you for writing. Mold develops on wet or damp surfaces, more commonly in places with limited airflow and direct light. To get rid of the mold in your dispenser, flush the whole area with chlorinated water. Remove the dispenser cover and clean the inside of the dispenser thoroughly with mild detergent followed with a dilute chlorine bleach solution, afterwards flushing the area thoroughly to remove any chlorine residue that may contaminate the water. Also, remove the water filter and flush the water tubing with chlorinated water. Go through this process every few months to reduce the risk of future mold. We hope you find this helpful."

        "repairInstruction": "part arrived within 24 hours. 1. remove plastic front of freezer door water and ice dispenser by looking at bottom edge of plastic for two slots within which to place a stiff scraper blade. very difficult to pop loose and very fragile plastic so take care not to break it. it just pops off two spots on the bottom side and hangs from the top no screws or anything.2. remove the two screws holding the water dispenser spout in place. oh yeah don't forget to turn the water off.3. this is a long plastic water tube that runs from the dispenser thru a plastic tube channel set in the solid foam core of the door thru the bottom hinge and connects to the water inlet junction.a. this replacement must be pulled from the dispenser area thru the door and out the bottom but it will not fit without cutting off the end of the spout. the hole in the hinge that it passes thru at the bottom of the door is to tight to allow anything other than the thickness of the tubing.b. pull the spout end of the tubing upward after disconnecting at the bottom in front behind the air grill. if it moves freely you are in luck - if it does not move freely then it is taped in place on the back of the dispenser area and now that whole assembly has to be unscrewed from the front of the freezer door in order to remove the tape so that the tubing can be pulled thru.4. once the tubing pulls easily as short distance in either direction it is time to attach the new tubing to the old tubing and pull it out the bottom of the door. i tried to use tape but it pulled off when i got to the door hinge on the bottom and it would not fit thru the hinge.a. on my model even one layer of tape would not fit thru the hinge. so i put some bricks under the freezer door to hold it up and removed the bottom hinge off of the tubing that was disconnected only a short distance away.5. use tape or place a screw with the head removed into both the old tubing and the new tubing so it can be pulled from the bottom moving the new tubing into place.mine broke off in the middle of this process and i had to remove the freezer door. take it completely apart to expose the conduit the tubing slides thru, then run an electrical fish tape thru the conduit and drag the new tubing thru, not a fun process but doable - just takes a bunch of extra time. 6. once the tubing was out the bottom i could then simply thread it thru the hinge easily and reassemble everything.

Apparently the old one was fine but since the refrigerator was in a flood and this part got submerged in water I kept it rather than returning it. I looked at everything closely and realized all the mechanical functions were working properly. Rarely does a condenser coil fail so I decided to look into recharging the coolant. Bought a 1/4 inch bullet valve, a 12oz. can of R-134a and a cheap resealable can adapter with hose, gauge and R22 to R-134a adapters. After a $30. investment Bingo, after one squirt the refrigerator began to cool and after 4oz. it now works better than new.

Frustrated, I looked at another diagnostic web s ite that claimed 90% of the time the problem is caused by the cold control thermostat. I tested mine and it tested bad, so I bought a control elsewhere, since your site did not list a PN for that device. I installed the new control and the freezer started up correctly. Looking at the wiring diagram for these parts, I see the start capacitor and defrost control are downstream of the cold control thermostat, and to my mind should have been the first part recommended for testing versus the parts I bought, so I am somewhat disappointed in the diagnostics on your site, where I spent about $80 for parts that were functional.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jerry, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat,  PartSelect Number PS2350702. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

It seems to go through a defrost mode at different times but is still covered in ice and frost. I’ve taken the top panel off to find the coils covered in ice and frost. I’ve cleaned all of this off and defrosted the coils, only for this to happen again in a couple of days.  Adjusting the temp doesn’t seem to make a difference. How can i fix this?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello and thank you for writing.\nIt certainly sounds like it could be a faulty defrost timer PS12585793 and/or possibly a malfunctioning thermostat PS2350702 you should check the part(s) for signs of damage or test with a multimeter, and replace the part(s) as needed. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance."

        "customerQuestion": "Refrigerator will not cool, evaporator fan is running but blowing warm air. Cooling control will click when turned to off and on.Compressor is hot to the touch, could the defrost timer be the issue?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello John, thank you for contacting us. We would recommend inspecting the evaporator coils and if you notice ice build-up around them, the issue is most likely related to the defrost timer, part number PS12585793, and the defrost heater, part number PS10064815. The warm air from the fan is an indication that there is built-up ice around the coils. Customer service is available 7 days a week if you require assistance placing an order. Thanks again for reaching out!"

I ordered both intending to replace first one, then the other as needed. With parts in hand, I pulled off the freezer control knob, used a nut driver to remove the two panel securing screws (behind the face, against the inner ceiling) a nd gently dropped the cover down. The control (temp sensor and cold control) is easily accessible as it sits wedged into two slots in the plastic cover. The control must be slightly lifted in order to extract the long sensor that attaches to the control and runs under it and into a plastic sleeve behind the panel (the new control comes with the sensor wrapped in a tight coil and it must be unwound for the install). Removed the three wires noting which color goes where. Used needle-nose pliers to remove the small push-on tabs and removed the control. After starting the new sensor probe into the sleeve re-attached the 3 wires to the new control. Used the original as a model for how to pre-bend the probe for the first 2 inches as it was mildly frustrating to position the unit back correctly. Pushed everything back into place, re-installed the screws and plugged the fridge back in...(you DID unplug it first, right?). Still haven't used the second part (defrost timer), but I expect it to go soon...it is a 17 year old refrigerator, after all. Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "First, the fridge was warm and the freezer was working and was iced in the back. I unplugged it and let it defrost. I took the back off the inside of the freezer to visually check the defrost thermostat. It looked ok. I put the back on again and plugged it in. The light came on in the fridge, but the refrigerator did not start running. Does this mean it is done for and I need a new fridge?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Terri,\n\nThank you for the question. Sounds like you need to replace the Defrost Timer. Defrost timers are part of the defrost circuit in your refrigerator and freezer. This timer cycles the defrost heater on and off. For every eight hours, the appliance timer will cycle for 30 minutes. The defrost heater is what melts the frost buildup on the evaporator coils, and it can prevent your freezer from frosting up. If your timer fails, the heater will not get the energy it needs to run, and frost will continue to build up and can cause the temperature in the fridge to rise. \n\n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Terri,\n\nThank you for the question. You can test the defrost thermostat and the defrost heater with a multi-meter. If they are in working order it is likely that the defrost timer is the faulty.\n\nIt is also a good idea to check the door gasket. When the room is dark, you can put a flash light into the fridge and close the door and see if there is light coming through anywhere around the gasket. \n\nHope this helps!"

You may need to open the door and remove the kick plate grill. Down in the bottom corner on the left side there will be a cover you can remove to expose the timer. \n\nHope this helps!"

For the last several days, i have noticed that some water comes out from the screws on the left side of the freezer particularly when i open the freezer widely. Since i cannot find the copy of the manual for this refrigerator-freezer (14.2 cubic feet).  Also, i have noticed that the freezer does not run as often as before and appears to be a bit warm. Please inform me as to what the problem may be or should i start thinking about buying another refrigerator-freezer. Thanks for your help.      Michael",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Michael, thank you for contacting us. The fridge components may just need a good cleaning. The coils at the back of the fridge by the compressor and condenser fan should be clean of all dust or debris. You can also remove the panel in the freezer to make sure the coils in there are not iced up, while you have that off you can make sure the evaporator fan is working properly, as that is what circulates the cool air into the fridge. It could also be as you mentioned, the defrost timer or the thermostat. The thermostat can be tested with a multi-meter. Hope this helps!"

        "storyTitle": "Freezer No Longer Cools",
        "repairInstruction": "Our spare 25+ year old Kitchenaid refrigerator (side-by-side model) refused to produce cold air. I could hear mechanical sounds and things \"clicking\", but the temps kept raising. This specific unit only had cooling coils in the freezer, and some ducts that route cold air into the fridge.I emptied the refrigerator completely, removed the ice cube bin and shelves, and left it unplugged for two days with the doors open. Once everything was dry, I plugged the unit back in -- within 8-10 hours, the unit was cold again. Lights worked, and fans in the freezer and back of unit worked. However... once the compressor turned off, it never came back on. This told me that the root cause lies with components that control when to turn off/on the cold flowing into the coils.I looked up my model on PartSelect website, and looked through their \"likely to fail\" list for my model. The defrost thermostat and defrost timer were at the top of the list, and symptoms made sense. Those two parts arrived within a week. The defrost timer was easy to install -- unplug old, plug in new. The defrost thermostat involved cutting existing wires, stripping a small section of sheathing, and attaching the wires to the new part with crimp caps and electrical tape. The electrical tape was there to cover the exposed area of the crimp cap and bundle the wires together. (I used 3M's \"Super 33+\".) Finally, reattach the harness to the socket, and attach the other plugs and grounding clamp.After re-attaching the rest of the required components, I plugged the unit back in. After about 24 hours, it had gone through at least one cycle and was appropriately cold. After letting it churn for another couple days and watching it closely, I felt confident that the problem had been fixed.** Side Notes **Definitely use caution around the fins on the coil. For my unit, the harness plug is directly above the fins, and required some effort to safely remove while not slicing up my hands. Extra long screwdrivers and patience helps a lot. Put a wedge behind the wheels of the refrigerator so that it doesn't back away from you while you work. And, of course, do all this while it is unplugged.** For the PartSelect Website Maintainers **If possible, please provide some better guidance on where to place the lead coming off the defrost timer. The Youtube video was nice, but some clarity on which pole/spade to attach it to (and where to find that info, besides \"consult your manual\") would help many people. Read less"

If you have have already replaced the bi-metal defrost thermostat and the defrost timer, there are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.

We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: the evaporator fan motor, the condenser fan motor, the damper control, the defrost timer, the defrost thermostat, and the cold control thermostat. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jeffrey, Thank you for the question. This sounds like a defective Thermostat Assembly. I suggest testing the Thermostat with a multi meter to check for resistance. You can also test the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat.The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mario,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If your fridge and freezer section are too warm, the majority of the time it is the capacitor that fixes the issue.  Another part you may have to check is the evaporator fan motor.  To verify which part is causing the issue you will need to use a multimeter.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "What procedure do I use to install the defrost timer kit for my model?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Dave,\n\nThanks for your question. You will need to disconnect the power from the fridge to begin with. The defrost timer is in the right-hand side of the control housing of the fridge. Unscrew the panel and remove it. Afterwards, remove the old defrost timer and replace it. We recommend taking a picture of the wires to ensure they are properly replaced.\n\nWe also have a video online for installing the part: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid2K9W_ums\n\nI hope this helps."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Richard, thank you for your question. We would recommend checking the damper, Damper Control Assembly Part Number: PS11750106, to be sure its opening enough to allow the air into the fridge from the freezer. If the damper and damper motor and opening and closing properly, the issue is probably the electronic board, PartSelect Number PS11755733,  which would have to be replaced. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Michael,\nThank you for your question.  Before removing and testing the defrost timer with a multimeter, unplug the refrigerator from the electrical outlet.  Using a multimeter on the Rx1 setting, with one probe touching the common terminal (it should be labeled \"3\" or \"C\"), touch the other lead to the other three remaining terminals, one at a time. Testing the first pair should produce a reading of zero, or near zero, denoting continuity. The second pair may also result in a reading of zero or near zero. Testing the third pair of terminals should produce a reading of infinity. If you do not receive these readings, you will need a replacement defrost timer. We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

Put old part back in now back to fridge running all the time. Any ideas or thoughts on this issue?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Stephen,\n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest maybe also checking your defrost thermostat as well. Usually when you are having defrosting issues it is because of either the timer or the thermostat. However you may want to also check your run capacitor and your start relay as well. Just to cover all of your bases. You would be able to test all three parts with a multi meter. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Welby, thank you for writing. Doing such with the screw driver is opening and closing the internal contacts inside manually. The first click you hear is the compressor shutting down and the defrost heater coming on.

The freezer is currently empty (except for the ice), which may be part of the problem, but it did this before it was cleaned out. The seal is in good condition (no visible damage). Could this be defrost timer related or another issue?Thank you",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi John,  \n1.Check the freezer light if this is applicable. Confirm that the light turns off when you close the door. \n2.Check the contents of your refrigerator and freezer to ensure it is cooling properly. Insufficient cooling can cause ice to melt and clump together.\nIf the freezer is not cooling properly then it is likely the defrost timer.\nThank you for your question and good luck with your repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Frank,\nThank you for your question.  This would be a preset timer.  The defrost timer is an electro-mechanical timer that operates a set of contacts that control both the compressor circuit as well as the defrost heater circuit. Most timers will activate a defrost cycle every 8-10 hours of compressor run time. This normally occurs about once every day or two. The defrost timer will normally terminate the defrost cycle after 20 to 30 minutes and the compressor and fans will start again. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Using a multimeter, the defrost heater can be checked for 29 ohms, the defrost thermostat is closed at 20 degrees and lower, it opens at 50 degrees, the defrost timer with refrigerator running, should be turning, you can usually see the internal gear turning through a  sight window on the side of it. It can be turned by hand to the defrost cycle and it should send 120v out to the defrost circuit on terminal 2 of the time and it should come out of defrost and back to running the compressor after about 20 min. The Defrost Timer Kit is part PS2167006. We have a video for you to access. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jim, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "Circulating fan works but will not come on.  Wired it direct but the coils freeze up about every 5 days.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mike,\nThank you for your question.  If the coils in your freezer are freezing every couple of days , there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the defrost heater, the defrost thermostat, the timer and the door gasket.  If the door is not sealing correctly, then moisture will get inside the refrigerator and frost will form when it cools.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Mike, Thank you for the question. The timer is part of the Adaptive Defrost Control Board, PartSelect Number PS2004546 located by the condenser at the back of the appliance. If the appliance is still running normally then the Start device and capacitor shoudl be fine. Sounds like the Control Board is defection. I looked up the part and it is listed as No Longer Available/Discontinued. There is no part substitutions listed. My suggestion here would be to call the manufacturer and see if they can provide you with a substitution for these part numbers. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Joe, thank you for contacting us. We have researched the model and would recommend checking the condenser coils and making sure they are clean and free of frost. If the issue remains, the problem might be with the condenser fan motor, part number PS395284, the evaporator fan motor, part number PS11738465, or the compressor kit, part number PS2580804.

I installed the timer and it worked great for about a week until the frost build up on the evaporator became too much again and then the symtoms returned. I then checked the heater elements and found that both were bad PLUS two clips to the elements were corroded. I then ordered the 2 heater elements. There is more than 1 heater element. Make sure you measure the length of each and then use the graph picture with \"Parts Select\" on the new ones before you order. There is about a 2\" in length difference. Also one comes in a kit with thermostat and wires. Wrong for me. I really wanted that unit as I needed the harness for the bad terminals but it was the wrong heaters and it also came with a new thermostat. Luckly I did not order that one but did order a new thermostat to make sure I did not have to go through this ordeal again. When the parts came I had already replaced the terminals and was ready to go when FedX came. Just make sure you check your heaters before just buying the defrost timer as it may keep you from going back to redo your repair. Just doing your home work before ordering may save you much time in your repair. \"PARTS SELECT\" was one day on both orders and I just ordered standard shipping. They are great to do business with.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Christine,\n\nThank you for the great question, \nStep 1: Unplug the refrigerator.\n\nStep 2: Disconnect the wires from the timer and timer motor. Remove the timer from its brackets by backing out two retaining screws.\n\nStep 3: Test the defrost timer with a VOM set to the RX1 scale. Clip one probe of the VOM to each defrost timer -- not motor -- wire, and turn the timer control screw shaft until it clicks. If the defrost timer is functioning, the meter will read zero. If the needle jumps, the defrost timer is faulty. Replace it with a new one of the same type.\n\nStep 4: Connect the new defrost timer the same way the old one was connected.\n\n\nHope this helps!"

I replaced new capacitor, compressor start relay and overload protector and defrost timer.  Now i am not sure defrost control board may need to replace?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Minh, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Clip-On Bimetal Defrost Thermostat with Leads. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

What else could be causing my problem",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Staunchis, thank you for your question. We would recommend testing the Part Number: WPW10662129 Capacitor. Usually if the fridge and freezer stay warm, it has something to do with the capacitor on the compressor. I hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "My refridgerator  is to cold won’t respond to temp control",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Yves, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

When you plug your appliance back in that should reset your board. If you are still experiencing a problem, you may have a loose wire connection or you may have to replace your control board. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If the display lights up and then the refrigerator shuts down a few minutes later, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the evaporator fan motor, the damper control assembly, the thermistor, the temperature control board, the defrost thermostat and the main electronic control board.  You will also need to check to see if the evaporator coils are frosted over as this can also cause the refrigerator shut down after a few minutes.  We hope this helps.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Joe,\nThank you for your question.  If the ice and water stopped dispensing, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the control bracket, the ice door kit, the ice bin coupling, the ice maker control assembly, the emitter and receiver boards, the micro switch, the water inlet valve, the water filter and the water tubing.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

There are instructions listed on our website with the part that a customer has left that you may reference, \"The control bracket is made of plastic and holds two microswitches that activate the ice dispenser and the water dispenser. The plastic clips that held the switches on the control bracket broke so that the switches no longer operated when the ice dispenser lever was operated. \n\nTwo screws held the external dispenser bezel, and two screws held the control bracket in place. The wiring and switches were transferred to the new bracket and the new bracket screwed into place. Then the bezel was replaced.\n\nTotal repair time was less than 5 minutes. The control bracket was $16.50 with shipping and arrived two days after I placed the order.\n\nThe PartSelect website had a clear diagram of the control bracket so I was comfortable with the order.\"  I hope this helps.

        "customerQuestion": "My refrigerator stopped dispensing both water and ice is this the right part",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ken, Thank you for the question. You first need to check to see if the water valve at the back of the appliance is releasing water. If the ice maker is making ice but not dispensing you need to replace the Dispenser Switch, Part number PS11739028. If the ice maker is not filling with water to make ice, you would need to look at the Water Valve, PartSelect Number: PS11731255. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Kenneth,\nThank you for your question.  To remove the front cover from the door, you will need to use a flat head screw diver along the bottom corners to allow it snap out.  There is a video on our website that you can reference on how to remove the front cover.  The refrigerator in the video may not show exactly like the one you have and the part being installed is an actuator, but it will give you a general idea on how to remove the part.  You will find the video under part number PS1526381.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

What would be wrong with the control bracket to look for as to why my water would not be working? I have not replaced the water control valve because it is still pumping for the ice maker. Any advice? Thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ronald, Thank you for the question. If the bracket is the issue, you will see physical damage to the bracket. The valve has two solenoids, one for the water dispenser and one for the Ice maker. I suggest testing the solenoids with a multimeter. There are two solenoids on the water valve. These solenoids are sometimes referred to as coils. There will be two wires attached to each solenoid. Be sure to label each of the wires so that you are able to properly reconnect them later. These wires are held in place with metal slip on connectors. Grasp firmly on each connector, one at a time, to disconnect the wire from the solenoid. Do not pull directly on the wire, pull from the metal connector. Set your multi meter to the ohms resistance scale X 1. Place each of the meter's probes to one terminal. Because the reading can vary from brand to brand and from model to model, there is no one reading you should receive. However, if your test produces a reading of infinity, then the solenoid is bad and the water valve should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

Only issue was that the videos showed that when the front panel is removed, there is a wire harness that has to be unplugged from part No. 38c. This was not the case. What I had was a Ribbon Cable Harness that plugged into the front of part No. 38 and the top of part 38C (the two power boards) I tried to disconnect it from part 38C by pulling it out, and apparently damaged the Ribbon Cable Harness. Later found a video showing how to remove this item properly when replacing power boards 38 and 38C. Have ordered a new cable from GRP and hopefully this will solve the problem, as there is no electrical current to the dispenser controls and the ice and water dispenser are not currently working. Would have been nice to know that there are two types of connections between these power boards; a cable harness that unplugs from 38C or a Ribbon Cable Harness that unplugs from from the face of part No. 38. Hopefully I have not damaged either of the boards or anything else. Professional repair man coming on Thursday to test the boards, micro switches, etc. The boards are quite pricey, ($550.00 for both) and since the refrigerator was manufactured in 2004, we will buy a new one before we pump any more into this older unit. Very important to know how to unplug this Ribbon Cable Harness from the boards before proceeding ! Plug in on 38C is very tricky and you will need to review a video showing how it is done. Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "Why does my life door, freezer is hard to open and will not stay open? I have to hold it open.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Virgil, thank you for the question. When a freezer is opened and then closed, some of the cold air is replaced with air at room temperature. This warm air then cools. The cooling of the gas causes a reduction in pressure inside the freezer, resulting in a partial vacuum that makes the door more difficult to open. However, a domestic freezer is not perfectly sealed and air will slowly leak in from outside and equalize the pressure. So, after a few minutes, the door becomes easier to open. We hope this information helps!"

Checking the model number unfortunately we do not have this symptom listed, for more specialized assistance or to speak with someone about this, I would suggest calling the manufacturer of the appliance directly. The freezer can not be turned off sorry without unplugging the full appliance. The front of the appliance has a set of rollers, so you will need to tip the appliance forward enough to rest on the two rollers and slide it out.  Hope this helps!"

So in order to make sure that the fridge did not fall over, and to keep the installation point off the ground so that I could align the screw holes, I needed to shim up the side of the fridge that I was working on.To tap in the shims, I used a hammer and a spare chunk of wood. I ultimately used 3 shims, and kept tapping until the roller wheel could roll freely. Then I knew that the fridge was high enough. After that, it was pretty easy to remove the 4 screws, align the new bracket, and replace the screws. After that, in order to get the shims out I could just extend the foot brake as it was designed, and that lifted the fridge enough for me to easily slide out the shims. After that I just had to level out the fridge by adjusting the two feet. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "It has been my experience that these motors sometimes die when the refrigerator is overfilled and motor strains to keep refrigerator cold. And this motor is used in several models of refrigerators. That said, sometimes the hook-up is slightly different between other units. The available video is good, but like I said, circumstances wil l be slightly different between various models. After cleaning out freezer (plug disconnected first), start to remove outer plastic covers. If you want to keep track of the different steps, you can take pictures with your cellphone. And if there are any connecting wire attachments you think you might not remember, again, you can take a picture, or label with tape (colored tape, or by writing on the tape). And for keeping track of the different-size screws, I place them in a muffin tin, keeping an order of left to right and top to bottom in the tin. When removing Styrofoam blocks in bottom center, make sure you remove any remaining ice underneath in the hole so refrigerator can \"breathe\". Freezer air is moved below to refrigerator compartment, so a blocked vent hole will strain refrigerator as it tries to maintain its temperature setting and can be the cause of your failed motor. After replacing motor onto bracket with grommets and blade, don't completely tighten. Position plastic cover with hole opening over motor and blade assembly. Twirl motor blade to see if there is any interference with cover. If not, take away cover and tighten motor on bracket. If there is any rubbing, adjust motor/blade assembly accordingly before tightening in place. Putting everything back together is in reverse order. Read less"

One thing I recommend is that you cover up the drain below the evaporator coil with a piece of paper and tape it down, because as I was putting the motor back I dropped a screw and it fell down the drain. So I had to go buy a new screw.Gi ve the cost of a repair man coming to fix a refrigerator that cost only $450 to begin with, doing this repair was well worth my time. (But I also had another refrigerator to move things to and could take my time and wait while they replaced the faulty part they shipped me.) Read less"

        "storyTitle": "There was frequently a loud buzzing sound that would come from the freezer.",
        "repairInstruction": "I wouldn't have tried it without the excellent YouTube video that gave step-by-step instructions! I set up a laptop next to the refrigerator and watched each step then did it myself. The instructions were very detailed and all of the parts looked exactly like what I was seeing. The only difference was that I didn't need to re move the floor of the freezer to get to the fan motor.I bought the fan motor, grommets (2), compression ring and fan blade because I wasn't sure which part was causing the problem, and figured that as long as I was in there I might as well put in all new parts.As it turned out, I did not need the compression ring, because the new fan blade came with a compression ring on it. This was different from what was shown in the video.Since doing the repair the freezer is now as quiet as it should be, which is a great relief. The project and the money spent were more than worth it. It was great not having to pay a repair man to do the work! Read less"

If the evaporator fan in the freezer or the condenser fan at the back near the compressor is making a noise, it could be an obstruction to the fan blade, so make sure the blades can turn freely and is not hitting against anything. You can test both the condenser fan motor and evaporator fan motor with a multimeter to see if either is faulty. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

Next I took out 2 screws from the bottom of the auger drive box and unplugged the wiring harness and removed the box. The wiring harness was a little tricky. The lock on the plug pushes in to unlock even though it looks like it pulls out,.3.next you must remove 2 screws from the left side bracket that holds the auger box and remove the bracket.4.Now take out 8 screws that hold the back panel in place and remove the back panel.5. now your looking at the evaporator fan blade and motor. The simple way to replace the fan blade is to unplug the motor and remove it from the freezer. It just sits in with nothing holding it. The fan requires a little pressure but should pull right off.

Watch the video and do the repair . . . it's very easy took me about 35 min once I got the freezer emptied, including cleaning the freezer. I used a Philips head screw driver and I think it was a 5/16 nut driver . . . you can do this. Freezer running fine, no noise. One thing I would be careful on is removing the back plate that covers the fan and motor, the edges can be sharp and you could cut yourself removing the back plate. Also don't try to put the rubber gasket in before you replace the back plate, install the back plate and the rubber gasket goes in easy peasy :) Read less"

Fridge and freezer are too warm and a clicking sound was being heard,  frost has built up on the bottom half of the freezer panel in this short time.  What would be my next step?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Pamela, Thank you for the question. With the information provided, you may have an issue with the Main Power Control Board,PartSelect Number: PS2339026.You can also test the Defrost Thermostat.\nThe best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Clyde, thank you for your question. The fan does not run continuously. It turns on and off to blow cold air into the fridge from the freezer. You're probably hearing the noise when the fan is running. I Would recommend removing the cover on the back of the unit to make sure the blade isn't hitting ice that has built up on the coils. If there is lots of ice buildup you would have a different issue and then we could provide some more information on the potential parts. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Joanne, thank you for writing. We advise checking the Run Capacitor. When testing a capacitor with a multimeter, you will need to set the meter between 10K and 1m ohms. Touch the leads from the multimeter to the corresponding leads on the capacitor. The red lead to positive and the black lead to the negative. The meter should start at zero and then moving slowly toward infinity. This means that the capacitor is in working condition. If the meter stays at zero, the capacitor is not charging through the battery of the meter, meaning it is not working. I hope this helps."

        "customerQuestion": "My refrigerator coil freezes up / freezer side is fine.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Michael,\nThank you for your question.  Frost on the evaporator coils will prevent air from flowing over the coils.  No air flow will cause the refrigerant in the coils to remain in a liquid state and keep it from vaporizing.  The refrigerant will travel past the coils and will eventually end up in the compressor and cause damage to it.  If there is frost on the evaporator coils, this may caused by the following:\n\n1. A bad defrost heater or the other components of the defrost system.  \n(The defrost system consists of the defrost heater, the defrost timer and the thermostat/defrost control.)\n2. High Humidity\n3. An evaporator fan motor not working correctly or not at all.\n4. No load on the evaporator coil.\n5. Dirty evaporator coils.\n6. Defrost intervals that are set too far apart.  We hope this helps.

        "customerQuestion": "FREEZER WORKING GREAT BUT REFRIDGERATOR IS WARM.  DAMPER IN FRIDGE OPENS AND CLOSES AND AIR CHASEWAY BETWEEN FREEZER AND FRIDGE IS FREE FROM ICE BLOCKAGE ( HAD THIS HAPPEN BEFORE). EVAP MOTOR IS RUNNING AND FAN BLADES ARE SPINNING.  ANY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Steven, thank you for contacting us. We would recommend checking the evaporator coils for ice build-up. If you notice the built-up ice, defrost it manually and check the defrost heater, part number PS11743496, and defrost thermostat, part number PS11743535, for continuity. Also inspect the damper control assembly, part number PS11750106. It controls the cold airflow from the freezer compartment into the refrigerator compartment.  If this does not help, the issue is probably related to the electronic control board, part number PS11755733. It manages the functions of the refrigerator such as cooling and defrosting time. We look forward to hearing from you if you need assistance with placing an order through our 7-days-a-week customer service. We hope this helps!"

These parts help keep frost buildup out of the evaporator coils and the air flow section. Good luck with your repair!"

We would recommend testing/replacing the thermostat, start relay, and overload as these parts work together to start the compressor and keep it running for the allotted time it takes to cool.

If the problem persists, we would recommend testing the defrost timer, defrost heater, and defrost thermostat. I hope this helps."

    "description": "This kit features a 5-blade plastic evaporator fan blade that rotates CCW and measures 4.5-inches in diameter and has a 3/8-inch-tall shaft. This kit also has a metal compression ring that secures the fan to the evaporator. The evaporator mechanism is normally located in the freezer and is responsible for pulling the warmer air over the condenser coils, cooling it off and then blowing and circulating that cooler air through the rest of the refrigerator. If the freezer compartment has a frost buildup or if there is a lack of cooling and airflow in your refrigerator, this fan likely needs to be replaced. To replace your evaporator fan, you will likely need a screwdriver and a set of pliers and check your user manual for the exact location of your evaporator fan.",

For our Amana ARB2214CW a start relay (WP12555902) and capacitor (WP65889-4) were listed on the first page of the Partselect parts list for my refrigerator. I ordered them, received them, removed the old capacitor and start relay (which rattled when shaken). and prepared to install my new parts. The new start relay did not match the old. The old start relay fit my wiring which had a single plug with two small female spade connectors in the plug. The new start relay required wiring with two separate female spade connectors; one the normal size and one larger. Phone calls to Partselect and to Westinghouse shed no light on the discrepancy. On the second page of the Partselect parts list was a combination of a start relay and a capacitor (W10613606) that matched my electrical connector. I could see the connection in the photograph. I ordered it and it fit. Easy peazy. That fixed the compressor start problem. Every time the freezer thermostat clicked on, the compressor started. Success. But… from our troubleshooting we now had a thermometer the freezer, and it was obvious that the temperature difference between the cold point where the thermostat turned the compressor off and the warm point where the thermostat restarted the compressor was much too wide. In addition, the knob was hard to turn and was sticky as it turned. Oiling it fixed the sticky knob problem but not the wide temperature difference problem. I ordered a new freezer thermostat (WP67003000), received it, installed it, and all is now fine with my refrigerator. The new thermostat was physically a little different from the original, but it fit and worked. I returned the first compressor start relay and capacitor and received a refund including the shipping charge. Read less"

I recommend replacing the Electronic Control Board,PartSelect Number PS11755733.The electronic control board is used in refrigerators to monitor and manage the temperature settings, such as cooling or defrosting times. If your fridge or freezer is too warm, too cold, is not defrosting, will not start, and/or runs too long then replacing the control board could solve your appliance problem.Hope this helps!"

There is no fuse or board, but I suggest testing the Compressor Start Device and Capacitor PartSelect Number PS8746522 with a multi meter. This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures. Hope this helps!"

If the freezer is working but the fridge is getting too warm, you will want to check to see if the evaporator fan motor is working to push cold air to the fridge from the freezer, as well as the damper is opening and closing to allow more or less air in.  You may also want to check that the coils behind the freezer wall are not frosting over, if they are you may need the defrost control board.

I suggest testing the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat.The best way to do this is to remove the Thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Alan, thank you for your question. We would recommend testing the start device, and capacitor which are on the compressor. You're testing for continuity so if they show continuity when tested they have not failed. The next step would be to test/replace the thermostat. The cold control is a temperature controlled switch that supplies power to the compressor and fan circuits in the refrigerator. If your refrigerator won’t start and no fans are running, then you may have a defective control. The temperature adjustment knob is attached to the control and is normally located in the fresh food section control panel. You can check the control for continuity with a multi-meter. You will need to remove power from the appliance first, remove the control from the housing and disconnect the terminal leads. As you adjust the control to a colder setting the switch should close and you should have continuity between the terminals. If not, then the control is defective and will need to be replaced. I hope this helps!"

The capacitor is also known as a run capacitor, and it is most often used in refrigerators and freezers. This part provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. Doing so enables the appliance to effortlessly maintain its internal temperature. If the capacitor is faulty your refrigerator or freezer might be too warm, or you may notice the compressor will hum, but it will not run. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Alan,\n\nThank you for the question. I suggest starting with the Controller, part number PS11728176. If the controller is not the issue it will most likely be the run capacitor PS3495561.\n\nHope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Our refrigerator makes a very loud rattling type noise when the comp. Kicks on,  the noise comes from behind the icemaker or back of the frig, likes its freezing up, it is only 2 yrs. Old, we have been unplugging it and manually defrosting the freezer which quits the compressor noise for a few weeks then it starts to get very loud again, what part should I install?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Tom, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS469522. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. You can also test the Defrost Heater,  PartSelect Number PS2581596. If there is no continuity then the part is defective and will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Tony,\nThank you for your question.  If your refrigerator and freezer sections are too warm, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the defrost timer, the evaporator fan motor, the run capacitor, the defrost thermostat, the cold control thermostat, the condenser fan motor and the door gasket.

The electronic control board listed for your model, part number 297370602, has been discontinued by Maytag and you will need to contact them to see if they have information on a replacement.

My fridge won’t get cooler than 53 degrees , even at the coldest setting - so shouldn’t the compressor being working nonstop to try and cool it ?  The condenser fan is not spinning, but turns freely when spun by hand. Not sure if I should replace the fan motor or the compressor start device ?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Melissa,\nThank you for your question.  If the compressor is warm, but not turning on, unplug the refrigerator from the electrical outlet and use a fan to cool it.  Once the compressor has cooled, plug the refrigerator back in.  If the compressor starts to work, but not the condenser fan motor, the motor will need to be replaced.  If the compressor does not come on check the start device and the run capacitor.  You will find the information on how to test these parts under Free Repair Help and Instant Repairman on our website.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

Some refrigerators use condenser fans to force air through the condenser coils and create that all-important cooling effect.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Joseph, Thank you for the question. It would be the Start Relay, Part Number: PS3502347 or the \t\nRun Capacitor, Part Number: PS3495561. The Capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off and the start relay briefly boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed. You can replace both parts or test them with a Multi Meter to check for correct resistance. Hope this helps!"

        "storyTitle": "Rear of upper shelf would freeze, while the rest of the freezer was dripping wet",
        "repairInstruction": "We opened our freezer last week only to find the bottom 2/3 was barely cold, while only the rear of the upper shelf was cold. In fact, it was covered in frost, despite being a frost-free model. Our frozen veggies were slushy, not rock hard, and our frozen juices were all liquid. We defrosted the freezer, plugged it back in, but immediat ely noticed that we didn't hear the 'whhoooooosh' that you typically hear when you close the freezer door. After 30 minutes, the rear upper shelf was frosty again, but the rest was still at room temp. We figured the freezer was a goner, so we started looking at new freezers. I headed online to see if I could fix it, and I eventually found this site. I had learned online that these symptoms can be caused by either a bad capacitor, or a bad controller (which the capacitor plugs in to). I guess you can't necessarily tell which of the two parts is defective, so I chose to order/replace both of them. I ordered the correct parts from partselect.com, and they alerted me that Frigidaire has a new replacement part for the capacitor. When the parts arrived (quickly, ftw!), I unplugged the freezer and snipped the two wires leading to the controller. Next I unplugged the controller from the compressor housing. I spliced the replacement controller's wires into the freezer's wires (using my own wire nuts...as none were included with my order :( ). I snapped the new controller onto the compressor mounting, and then plugged the capacitor in. I plugged the freezer back in, and it was time for the moment of truth. The interior light of the freezer came on, and I could hear the compressor 'humming'. I could hear it humming before the repair, so the big test was to see if it got cold. I was nervous because the freezer DIDN'T make the 'whoooshing' noise right away, but after just an hour, the 'test' mug of water was already turning into ice. It was fixed!!!! If you have these symptoms, you CAN do this!!! Unplug the freezer. Cut two wires. Unplug the controller. Splice two wires. Plug in the new controller. Snap in the new capacitor. DONE!!! Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Dean, thank you for your question. The start relay briefly kick starts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed. If the compressor is not kicking on you will want to replace the start device part number PS8689661. You may also want to test/replace the run capacitor part number PS2333670 as well, as these parts sometimes fail together. The run capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature in your fridge and freezer. I hope this helps!"

Once done and the panel was replaced I started the refrigerator. The freezer seems to be at temperature but the refrigerator side is not cooling down to temp. It seems the motor on the freezer side keeps cycling. On and off sound but there is constant air flow. The ice maker is turned off for now. The fan for the condenser in the bottom back of the refrigerator is working. Any ideas?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Tom, Thank you for the question. This could indicate there is a issue with the Defrost Cycle. We suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. We hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Katy, Thank you for the question. If the compressor is kicking on and off as normal, the start relay and run capacitor should be good. We suggest checking the Evaporator Fan Motor to make sure it is spinning at a normal speed to circulate the air over the coils. You can also test the Defrost Heater with a Multimeter. You should get an approximate reading of 10 to 150 ohms. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call.

        "customerQuestion": "How do I test the temperature sensor.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Rene,\n\nThank you for the question. The best way to do this is to remove the thermistor from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature or grab a glass of ice water to test the thermistor. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced.\n\nHope this helps!"

It took him quite a while to figure out and believed it was the condensor inverter  and the motherboard (that he said was \"fried\").    He replaced both items (...it took a good part of 2 days...).   it appeared that all was working and both sides of frig were starting to get cold; we had to leave town again.    when we got home 2 days later, both sides were at 72 degrees again.    we called repair guy who was coming the next morning.    when he arrived, all was operating fine, and temps were \"very close\" to their good settings (i.e. freezer @ 0  and  other side @ 35 degrees).     hard to fix something that's working.    we've continued to \"check the temps\" every few hours the past 7 days and all has been ok.   tonight we went to the freezer and everything liquid again (...we haven't put any meat in freezer until we know all ok....).  temps at 45 47 degrees (both sides).   compressor is \"cool to the touch\" (i.e. not running) but fan is running.   i'm thinking that maybe its the temperature sensor(s) causing the problem.       any ideas?   we've already spent $650 on repairs + cost of all food in frig & freezer being lost.   the 36\" GE monogram (counter depth), side by side  is 9 years old.",

        "repairInstruction": "In my case, it was the solenoids. Take off the top be removing two screws on back, then slide the top back and off. Then remove little screws on top that hold the plastic bar with the electronic controls. This very easily will pop up, don’t unplug it, just lay it aside on top of machine. Under this you can see the white metal piece that contains the door. This whole piece comes off with the door in place. Look for four screws across the top, remove em. Then open the door, there are two facing out about 10 inches apart. Remove em. Now slide whole door out (sort of a hinge on the bottom) from the top. After it pops out from the tops, lean it out about 1 foot then pull up hard. It comes off at the bottom. Gently unplug the door, you will see the wire to unplug. I used a small screwdriver to gently pry the plug apart to get it started. After the front panel is removed, you can see the gas valve lower right. On top of the gas valve which is about 5 inches by 5 inches, you will two black cylinders on top of it. Cylinders that are 1.5 inches tall and about 1 inch wide. These are your solenoids. These create an electromagnetic field that opens the gas valve. There is a silver colored piece of metal on top of them holding them in place with two screws on top. Take this cover off the two black solenoids (Black cylinders). Then remove the cylinders after gently unplugging them. Do not just pull on the wires. Use an ohm meter to test the old ones after you slide them up and off what looks like a silver post. There are two metal tabs on one where the plug plugs onto it. Set your ohm meter for 1000 and touch the two metal tabs. Your meter should say there IS a circuit. If your meter says there is no circuit your solenoid is bad. The other solenoid has threee tabs. Hold your solenoid with the metal plugs down and the cylinder is standing upright. Have the three prongs facing you. The prong on the left as you face the solenoid it is your common. Touch this prong and then with the other wire touch the middle prong. You need to see a circuit that is closed, or connected. If there is no circuit your solenoid is bad. Now touch your two testing wires on the two outside prongs. You still need to see a circuit. If no circuit you have bad solenoid. Replace em. The solenoids die slowly over years. Your dryer will start to take longer to dry. This is sign of dying solenoids. To the left of the gas valve you can see the sensors that determine if the air coming out of the dryer is damp or dry. Replace them at the same time. Where you are the burner, on the left of the 5 inch wide tube it is in you will see a sensor, rectangle shape 2 inch by 1 inch. This determines if the lighter is glowing. Replace it at this same time. On top of the burner tube, top right, hard to reach, there is another sensor that shuts it all down if it is over heating. There are two wires plugged into it. Use a MAGNETIC and very short philips head to remove it. Slowly, don’t drop the screws. Pull the whole sensor out while plugged in, then unplug it using a screw driver to help get it started unplugging. When the new sensor goes in, screw it on place first. Do not try to screw the new one in with wires on it. It is not easy, but you can do it. Use a small flash light etc to help see. Once screwed on, plug in your wires. It does not matter which wire goes on which end. So after you replace all your sensors (4 total) and you replaced those two round black solenoids, you can put it all back together.Do not buy cheap piece of sh-t parts. The cheap ones are made in China with short cuts, low quality metal and ceramics. Cheap. Use authentic Maytag parts, each sensor should be like $30. I replaced all of mine for $180.

First you will have to disconnect the power to your appliance and then remove the sensor. Second you will set your multi-meter to the lowest setting and then calibrate it to show zero. Take each probe of your meter and touch one to each of the prongs on your sensor. If the meter continues to show zero or infinite ohms, your sensor is bad and needs to be replaced.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi John,\nThank you for your question.  To test a radiant flame sensor, Set a multimeter to the lowest ohms of resistance setting. The sign for ohms looks like a horseshoe, and depending on your model, this setting could be RX1, 200, 2K, or X10. Touch the probes together on an analog meter and rotate the dial on the side of the meter until the needle rest at zero on the far right of the display.  Pull the wire connectors off the flame sensor terminals. Touch one multimeter probe to one of the flame sensor terminals and touch the remaining terminal with the remaining probe. If the needle sweeps to the right and rest at zero on the analog meter, or it the digital meter displays zeros, the flame sensor is good. If your meter displays any other reading, the sensor is bad and must be replaced. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Catherine, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

One of the temperature sensors is located down at the bottom of the refrigerator near the evaporator.  If you do not see it there then take a look on the side walls of your freezer section for a little cover that would be over the sensor.  The refrigerator temperature sensor is located either with the controls or on one of the side walls with a cover over it.  If you would like to place an order for it, you may order it either online or by calling our customer service line and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

(This step was the most difficult for me... I had to use the mirror to confirm that I was properly aligned.)8 - Turned on the power (and shut off the \"FAST ICE\" option -- may not be available on all ice maker models).9 - I scooped out a gallon of ice for my tea maker.10 - A few hours I checked the bin level to confirm that the ice maker was behaving.All in all, a very simple repair and certainly beats paying someone $200 or $300 for a five minute job.

The one in the fresh food compartment is located in the ceiling in the light module, you would need to remove the housing and cover to access it. The one in the freezer is at the back corner with a cover over it, you would use a screwdriver and insert it into the tab at one side to remove the cover and access the thermistor inside the cover.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello John, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat, part number: PS1525674. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater, part number: PS426768. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor, part number: PS1527511. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So, it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dave, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS11750673.The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Compressor running but will not cool",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi RC, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

I was not sure what the problem was ahead of time except for the fact that no air was coming in from the freezer section; this is where the air diffuser is. I probably only needed to replace the diffuser.I turned the circuit breaker fo r the refrigerator off. There was a small section of plastic covering the wires that run from the top console inside the refrigerator to the back of the refrigerator where the diffuser is. I took this off (one screw) and then the diffuser is connected in the refrigerator side with one screw. To push the diffuser from the freezer, I needed to take off a piece of plastic directing the flow of air from the freezer. I needed to move the ice maker forward a little; it moves forward easily (it sort of clips into place). Once the diffuser was visible from the freezer, I pushed it out or disconnected the four clips holding it in and it came right out. Once this is done, you simply unplug the old and plug in the new and put back in place. This took less than 15 minutes total time. Online diagrams makes ordering parts and fixing easy.Once the new diffuser was in, I could tell I was golden because I was getting cold air.

(I should also mention that we found 2 of them attached to the diffuser, one that went back into the freezer and one that stayed inside the case for the diffuser on the refrigerator side. The directions didn't mention 2 of them.)  We replace the one on the refrigerator side.  The diffuser opened right up and we began to see the temperature drop.  About an hour into the process, the temperature started to rise again and soon it was back above 60 degrees. I have not yet changed out the diffuser I ordered.  I am unsure how to proceed. I don't know what the problem might be now.  Is it possible the diffuser is the problem? Did I need to replace both thermistors?  Any way to test which thermistor is the bad one?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Donis, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the thermister. At 77 degrees it shoudl read 2.7K ohms of resistance and 42K ohms of resistance at 0 degrees. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "My freezer started getting ice crystals and got colder than normal. The refrigerator side has moisture on everything and ice hanging from the duct that brings air in from the freezer. It also is colder than normal. Finally there is a big puddle of frozen water on the freezer compartment floor. What's your suggestion?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Hall, Thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: bi-metal defrost thermostat, thermistor, defrost heater, evaporator fan motor and main control board. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "My refrigerator is making a popping sound by the air diffuser box.  It is also not getting cold only on fridge side.  Could it be the thermistor?  If so, how do i take off the cover to the air diffuser to get to it.  There are no visible screws around it or anywhere in the side wall of fridge.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Robin,\n\nThank you for your question. There is a screw on a cover that is just ahead of your damper that you will have to remove to reveal how to remove your damper. Once you remove that cover you will be able to remove the screw that holds your damper cover in place, which will give you access to replace your thermistor. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Lew, Thank you for the question.I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "repairInstruction": "I started by finding thw dispenser door part. On the parts diagram it showed all the other parts I might need to replace. Due to the age of the fridge I decided to replace them all, especially the sprIngs. I made sure to watch all of the videos for each part. Although they overlapped, each one showed the repair in more detail. The repair was as shown. If your frosge has been in service like mine for many years, plan on taking thw whole ice chute and dispenser door assembly out for thorough cleaning. One trick I learned is to take pictures as I disassemble so I can refer back for reassembly. When I put it together, the microswitch didn't work. I ordered that part, the only one I missed initially and installed it when it came in. Everything worked well. There was no video for the torsion spring and alignment of the chute and frame is tricky, make sure you take a picture. Part Select should dona video foe that. The putty knife trick for the trim ring was key. It was only shown in one video for an internal part so glad I watched them all. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "Remove the screws from the door and replace the switch interlock and door latch. The problem is fixed and the dishwasher works fine so far (about three weeks) now. The source of the problem looks more like the door latch because I use to push the door in to get it going before I replace the parts. The v ideo I received via email that show the how to do it was very helpful.————-Update after more than month. (12/30/2020)The problem still persists. However I have a possible solution for it that doesn’t require any parts at all. The entire dishwasher is tilted backward. As the washing started and the water pileup in the bottoms of the dishwasher, it pull the entire dishwasher back work causing the switch interlock to release (open the relay causing the door open been sounds). Level the dishwasher so that it doesn’t tilt backwards and this should fix the issue. I will post the latest after a month. If you need more info I can send a picture to describe the issue more clearly.—————————Update 01-06-2021The problem still persists. The above theory I had was wrong and didn’t make any difference. However, I have a permanent solution but it may not be ideal for most people ??. The relay that get close/open when the door is close/open is now always CLOSED. To start the dishwasher just press start and make sure you don’t open the door while the dishwasher is running. It will not stop. I am sorry and I know it’s not a good solution but it’s kind of funny. Read less"

However, the water dispenser will also occasionally not dispense, it sounds like there is air in the line.  Any thoughts on what might cause this?  (i've replaced the filter several times and still having the issue)  thanks!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Andy,\nThank you for your question.  If you have air trapped in the water line, you will need to flush the water system to remove it.  Press and hold the water dispenser lever for a few minutes to completely flush the air out. If the water lines are not fitted correctly or if you have just recently replaced the water filter, air may become trapped in the water lines.  When you install a new water filter, it is important to flush the water filter before using it.  Consult your owner's manual for information on the correct procedure for your refrigerator.  If air is not the issue and the dispenser continues to occasionally not dispense water, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check dispenser door solenoid assembly, the water filter head, the electronic control board, the microswitch and the dispenser door assembly and flapper.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

Then you should be able to replace the spring. If you do need more information about the repair. You may have to contact a technician or speak with your manufacturer. Good luck with your repair."

Due to the age of the fridge I decided to replace them all, especially the sprIngs. I made sure to watch all of the videos for each part. Although they overlapped, each one showed the repair in more detail. The repair was as shown. If your frosge has been in service like mine for many years, plan on taking thw whole ice chute and dispenser door assembly out for thorough cleaning. One trick I learned is to take pictures as I disassemble so I can refer back for reassembly. When I put it together, the microswitch didn't work. I ordered that part, the only one I missed initially and installed it when it came in. Everything worked well. There was no video for the torsion spring and alignment of the chute and frame is tricky, make sure you take a picture. Part Select should dona video foe that. The putty knife trick for the trim ring was key. It was only shown in one video for an internal part so glad I watched them all. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "Problem: I have a black colored GE 24.9 cubic inch side-by-side refrigerator, model #GSH25KGMCBB that I purchased new in 2002. The ice cube maker stopped supplying ice cubes and the ice dispenser door stopped operating.Repair: Unplugged refrigerator first and shut off the house water supply valve. Removed the lower rear acce ss cover and replaced the double solenoid water valve. Icemaker and water dispenser tubing are easily removed by pushing in and holding down the white plastic collar where the tubing is inserted into each port on the valve body; no tools required to release the tubing. Hint: When reconnecting the water outlet tubing, ensure the tube diameter matches the port on the valve body. Insert each tube by hand back into the ports of the valve until they firmly seated.Removed the control panel by inserting a small screwdriver into the three holes located on the bottom of the control panel body. Removed all of the ice dispenser door hardware and the door solenoid. The door solenoid armature was seized by corrosion. Cleaned off all of the accumulated dirt and mold with a 1:10 ratio solution of bleach and water. Replaced all of the door recess and solenoid valve fasteners with my own stainless steel #4-40 thread, 0.25\" long socket head screws for longer life. The installation of the remaining hardware is the reverse of how it was removed.The installation looks very clean now and $150 later, the ice maker still doesn't produce ice!Root-cause analysis: I disconnected the ice cube maker water supply line from the double solenoid valve at the rear of the refrigerator and was able to blow air with my mouth straight through the outlet of the water tubing located inside of the freezer compartment; to ensure it wasn't blocked. Verified the water supply valve is not being energized! Turns out that the blinking green LED indicator on the ice cube maker is indicating more than the troubleshooting guide does about that because the white colored insulated conductor in the electrical harness for the ice cube maker is not energizing the solenoid on the water supply valve!Conclusion: the ice cube maker assembly is next on the list of replacement parts!!

If your water dispenser is not closing after you remove the glass, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check micro switch, the dispenser door assembly or flapper, the dispenser door solenoid assembly, the dispenser housing shield assembly and the dispenser control board.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

        "customerQuestion": "I have a Whirlpool model number ed5ltaxvl01 refrigerator/freezer. My auger motor went out so i purchased another one to replace it. It lasted about a month then it went out. Rust appeared where the shaft goes into the motor so i believe that moister is getting to the motor and shorting it out. In order to replace the shaft seal i need to remove the ice bin and container. Problem. . . While the refrigerator was still under warrantee the release mechanism to remove the ice bin failed. After contacting Whirlpool they sent out a technician to make the necessary repair. The repair did allow us to remove the ice bin but it just didn’t feel quite right in the procedure. The repair was temporary and was again inoperative within a few operations. The release operating mechanism fell out and there is no way to disengage the bin & container that is required in order to get to the seal. Any logical ideas?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jim, thank you for your question. It sounds like you might have to replace the parts if the repair did not fix the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi William, thank you for the question. Damaged or pinched water lines could be the reason for a slow water dispenser. You will need to inspect the water line outside your fridge to check it for damage. If you do not see any damage, make sure there are no “kinks” in the tube. If you want to check the water pressure on the refrigerator from the house. Just put the water supply hose in a 5-gallon bucket and let it run for 15 seconds to make sure you have good pressure and the saddle valve or whatever valve supplies water from the house to the refrigerator is not being restricted. If the water supply is good, disconnect the water line under the valve and put a towel underneath. Push the dispenser paddle and see if the pressure coming out of the valve is good. If all checks well, you are down to either the water filter or the filter housing. If this does not help, we recommend checking the water inlet valve, part number PS11712338. Glad to be of help!"

You will need to remove the ice bucket from the door.  Press the release valve to release the bucket from the door and remove any ice from the bin.  Turn the bucket upside down and you should see the ice bin button on the left hand side.  There should be 2 screws securing it in place.  Unscrew them and remove the old ice bin button.  Screw the new ice bin button in place and put the ice bucket back on the door.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      {
        "customerQuestion": "Why is the rail on my door extremely hot",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Gary,\nThank you for your question.  If the mullion is hot, the heat is generated by a heat loop located in the mullion and the walls near the gaskets to prevent moisture and frost from developing.  This will usually last 24 hours.  If it is warmer than normal, the issue may be with the condenser and you will need to clean it.  If the air flow around the condenser is blocked by dust, dirt and other debris, this will cause the both the mullion and walls near the gaskets to become warmer than normal.  It is important to clean it on a regular basis.  Also, if your refrigerator has an Energy Saver feature, this controls the heat and may cause the mullion to become warmer than normal.  You will need to check you owner's manual for information on how to use it.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

Then I removed the fire panel over the terminal block and the issue was apparent. The nuts on the terminal block were corroded. This had cause the resistance in the connection to raise and burn up the wire to my oven plug at the terminal block. I removed the whole back panel and everything else seemed OK visually. 1. I go new connectors for the oven plug, stripped the wires, and crimped on the new connectors.2. The terminal block DOES NOT come with the nuts to connect the wire to the terminal block. Mine were so corroded they had to be replaced. So I went and purchased the correct ones and installed the terminal block and reconnected all the wires.3.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Pat, thank you for your question. If the start button isn't working properly, and you have to hold the start button we would recommend testing oven thermostat PartSelect Number PS11749737 first. This oven temperature sensor, for ranges, works together with the oven control board to measure and regulate the oven temperature.Testing the temperature sensor probe on your oven is easy. With the sensor at room temperature, measure the resistance between the two prongs at the end of the sensor connector. The resistance of the sensor should read approximately 1080 – 1090 ohms at room temperature. If that part measures within those readings, the electronic board should be replaced. I hope this helps!"

If the top elements as well as the oven are not working, I would recommend changing the terminal block and perhaps the power cord to the unit. Also check the plug  the appliance is plugged into to make sure the right voltage of power is coming to the unit. If the stove top burners are working but neither the baker OR the broil unit is working inside the oven section, the part you would need to replace is the Electronic Oven Control Board part number PS2357664. You may also want to check the Long Oven Sensor PS1570174. I hope this helps!"

To verify the year of your refrigerator, we would need both the model and serial numbers from it.  Here is a link from our website that you may reference on where to find the model number on your appliance, https://www.partselect.com/Find-Your-Refrigerator-Model-Number.aspx.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Also check the Fill Tube at the back wall to make sure there is no damage and it is properly seated so the water goes into the Ice Maker mold and does not miss the ice maker causing the leak. If they are both good, you can watch to see if the Ice Maker is over filling. If so, the Water Inlet Valve may be faulty. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

        "storyTitle": "not cooling, water in refrigerator",
        "repairInstruction": "For several years, had problem with water accumulating in the bottom of the refrigerator...took out the \"custom cool\" drawer and assigned my kids the responsibility to dry it out daily after supper (about a fourth of cup of water daily)...the water was condensing and dripping down the left side of the refrigerator... NOT coming from the r efregerator evaporator drip pan area. Then the refrigerator and freeezer had erratic cooling...paid 4 grand for this GE stainless steel on the front/sides frig about 5 years ago... then my wife said she wanted a new refrigerator...what the heck...went on to numerous websites and finally decided to do my own \"overall\"...had nothing to lose except the price of the parts. A helpful web site is the GE technician site at...www.manualinstruction.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ge-sidebyside.pdf. I ordered the four thermisters, a new freezer defroster (the old one was probably OK...the freezer coils were not \"iced Up\"), and a new defroster thermonmeter. While I was at it, I ordered a new refrigerator evaporator drip pan that was rusting a bit. As per other instructions in this website, just spliced in the new thermisters,used wire twist caps and eletrical tape to seal them. The GE site is a bit more elaborate on the \"correct\" way to do this. The refrigerator evaporator coil is a bit tricky...see the above ge site...but I just cut the rubber thermister holder down the middle and then tracked the thermister through the holder and stuck it in the block and taped the holder back together...(removed the block first ) and then zip-lined the block back to the coil like it was originally. It was about 3 hours to do everything...and guess what...temp in the freezer is -5...temp in the frig is 36...and NO MORE WATER IN THE BOTTOM OF THE REFRIGERATOR, NO MORE WATER DRIPPING DOWN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE REFRIGERATOR...what will my kids do...I feel like the refrigerator guru now. Wish I had done this several years ago. The parts I ordered came in 3 days. I'm lovin my refrigerator now and my wife is lovin me. It's really easier than I thought it would be...the GE tech website has some \"diagnostic\" info to isolate different problems... but I just decided to replace \"everything\" since the parts were not that expensive and it was going to be a \"do or die\" on getting a new refrigerator.

        "storyTitle": "Trough Drain pan was rusted",
        "repairInstruction": "First I removed the shelving from the refrigerator side I then removed the cover to the refrigerator condenser which consisted of a plastic cover and a styrofoam inner chamber cover. The Condenser is held in place with two stainless phillips head screws. I removed the screws and gently pulled the condenser forward so that the Drain pan co uld be easily removed. The drain pan is made out of thin sheet metal with a galvanized coating that will not hold up it will start rusting in a short time. I inspected the drain pan cleaned it up with a little Muretic acid and it had too many rust holes so I couldn't repair it. I ordered a new Drain pan on Part Select and when it came in I washed it and dried it completely then I sprayed it with Cold Galvanizing compound with zinc particles. You can get this from Home Depot on the spray paint isle. Hopefully the spray Galvanizing will keep it from rusting in the future and leaking inside the refrigerator. The Trough Drain Pan should have been made of Stainless sheet metal or plastic I don't really know why they used the galvanized coated pan. Everything went back together in reverse with no problems. Hopefully this drain pan will last longer than the first drain pan because it was only 4 years old. I remember when the older refrigerators would run for decades. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "refridgerator was not defrosting & so was getting warm",
        "repairInstruction": "On the PartSelect website, I chose the 'refridgerator is too warm' problem choice. The site sugested replacing the sensors so I purchased them. The drain trough on the refrigerator side was leaking and it and the defrost thermostat were not too expensive so I bought them too. Once the parts arrived I installed them. I had alread y disassembled the inside of the freezer. The sensors and thermostat had to be connected electrically. So I cut off the old parts and stripped their wires. (the new parts' wires were already stripped.) I then used wire nuts to connect the new wires to the old and stuffed the wire back into its compartment and installed its cover. The defrost Thermostat has to be clipped to the refrigeration line. So after attaching its wires I had to work it into its place. I then reassembled the inside of the freezer and let it sit for an hour before turning it back on. Once it was turned on it seemed to work well, but after only 3 or 4 days the coils began freezing over again. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "Water leaking from under refrigerator. Initially believed leak was from filter assembly. Removed filter and shut off water supply but leak appeared at different intervals again. Large puddle of water coming out from under refrigerator. Removed back lower panel and checked for leak, but didn't find any. My wife was also checking for le ak and found a crack in drip tray. Only way we could get the drip tray out was to first remove front lower panel, disconnect and remove wiring harness in front of drip tray, unbolt water filter assembly, and unbolt water solenoid unit at rear of refrigerator. Their water lines connect to filter assembly. My wife controlled the water solenoid unit to give me play as I pulled the filter assembly out as much as I could from the front. I could now wiggle the cracked drip tray out from under the filter unit. Replaced drip tray and reinstalled wiring harness, water filter unit w/new filter, and re-bolted water solenoid unit at back of refrigerator. Replaced back lower panel after turning water back on and checking for leaks. Replaced front lower panel. The reason still had leak after initially turning off water supply was because the drip tray is used to catch the water when refrigerator goes into the defrost cycle. Since the original drip tray had cracked, water only appeared on floor after defrost cycle. Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "Water leaks into the bottom of the freezer",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Barbara, thank you for your question. It sounds like the drain tube that takes water from the unit to the evaporator drip tray is frozen. I would recommend defrosting the unit, and pouring a bit of hot water down the drain tube to see if you can free up any ice in the tube. If there is no ice built up in the drain tube and the water is still leaking into the freezer it might have something to do with the defrost parts that keep the unit frost free. Those parts would be Heater, Defrost\nPartSelect Number: PS11740459, Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat PartSelect Number: PS11750673, and Electronic Defrost Control Board with Wire Harness and Screws PartSelect Number: PS372261.  I would recommend testing these parts if the water continues to collect at the bottom of the freezer. I hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "How do you get to the drip tray to clean it?Model # 106.52522100",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Karen, Thank you for your inquiry. Some models will allow you to remove the tray by accessing it from the front, but some manufacturers will tape it in place but you can cut the tape off the tabs, you may have to open up the back to remove part the tape on the back. First, remove the back access panel with a 1/4 inch nut driver, and pull the lower half of the cover away from fridge, then you should be able to pull it out of the tabs and remove it. Next use a 1/4 inch nut drive to remove the screws holding the water inlet valve in place and carefully pull it out and disconnect the water tube. You may have to remove the clamp from the water supply line to allow for some slack.  \nNow go around to the front of the fridge and remove the bottom kickplate-there should be a locking tab on each end, use a putty knife to release the tabs. Remove the water filter housing by first unhooking the support bar and use a 5/16 nut drive to remove the screws holding the housing to the frame. Carefully pull the water filter housing out and set it to one side. Now you should be able to pull the evaporator tray out-it should be located about 6 inches from the front. \n\nThen replace the filter housing and kick plate, then reconnect the tube to the water valve and reconnect the water fill line. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Water from the drip tray is filling up and running over every 2 days what is my fix?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mike, thank you for your question. The first part to test would be your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids that control either the dispenser or the ice maker. Even if your dispenser is working the ice maker solenoid may not be and vise versa. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The problem can occur due to a faulty defrost control board, which causes excessive defrosting. You may need to replace your defrost control board, part number PS11753802. Usually, when the drip pan gets full, you have to manually remove it and clear the water. In normal conditions, the drip pan doesn't get full so fast. We hope this helps."

Installation seemed very easy - two screws holding the tank itself, one hose to the water supply in the back, and another to the bo ttom of the freezer door to dispense. Then the hard part started after it was installed. First, I could hear the click but no water was coming out. After several views of youtube videos, I realized there was a plug in the hose to the supply side. Duh! So now I had water, but also a slow drip when drawing water. I believe the issue was that I was not pushing the hose on firmly enough, and eventually I got it right. Also, you need to understand the connector: there is a little ring around the place the hose fits; pushing it TOWARD the housing releases the hose, and pulling it back AWAY locks the hose it place.

        "customerQuestion": "Water tank keeps freezing.     Prevention???????",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Vernon,\nThank you for your inquiry.  For certain refrigerators, the drawers inside refrigerator have their own temperature settings.  Food inside the refrigerator will absorb the cold air.  If the bins are set to the highest cold setting and they have no food or very little food inside them then the water tank will freeze.  You should only use the highest cold setting if the bins are full.  In general as well, if there is very little food in the refrigerator cold air will sink and stay at the bottom of the refrigerator and this will cause the water tank to freeze.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Joe, thank you for your question, and feedback about completing the tank repair! The water should be distributed within a few minutes. Allow for a bit of time for the water to get back through the system. The part the water lines connect to at the back of the fridge is called the water valve. If there is a little water leaking from there it should be replaced. That part number is PartSelect Number: PS304374 and we have an installation video on that part as well! Good luck!"

I disconnected the tubing from the water solenoid and water flows fine through the solenoid. As far as I can tell, the tank and tubing are the only things between the solenoid and the water dispenser.Is it possible that they are blocked?If so, should I just replace the whole tank assembly?  Thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mike, Thank you for the question. In most cases if the dispenser is not dispensing it is the Micro Switch. The switch can be tested for continuity with a Multi Meter. It is also good to have the filter replaced ever 6 months. Only way to know if the water tubes are blocked is to remove them and run water through them. Hope this helps!"

There are fittings that are made into the plastic of the part on both ends, however that is all that comes with it. The blue tube goes into one of those fittings and then there is one on the opposite side for another tube that would be on your appliance already. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

I figured if I was replacing the one for the refrigerator door I might as well do the freezer door too.Very easy to take the old ones off, take the putty knife clean tracks out. Putting the new ones on, was a little harder to do. You have to start in the corner and push the gasket into t he slot. You need strong hands to do this. Once I heard them click in, they guided themselves the rest of the way. Once they are on, check to make sure they touch the frame of the door. My freezer was perfect, but the refrigerator had an area of 25 inches that did not touch the frame. I called partselect.com and they sent out another new gasket for the refrigerator door. (I had to pay for this one but was told once I mailed in the defective one, they would credit me the cost of the returned one) I took off the bad gasket and installed the 2nd new gasket and that one was perfect.

Sometimes after installation the gasket may bulge out and the door will not close completely. I would try some adhesive tape on the door for a few hours to see if this helps the door seal properly and to remove any bulges that are there.  If this does not work then you will have to contact our customer service line as the part my be defective.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

I have taken out the ice maker, and saw some ice build up in the water receiving funnel, but it was not blocked.  I am assuming that the ice make will work, and it is just an issue with the correct pressure getting the water to the ice maker.  I am not sure what i can change out to fix this, and or if it is worth it.  Can you please help with the diag, and give some pointer on how to change whatever you suggest.  Thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Steve, \nThank you for your questions.  The issue may be with the water filter.  It is recommended that before you use the filter, that you flush it before use.  You will need to find a container that will fit in the water dispenser.  You will need to position the container in the water dispenser and press in to begin dispensing the water.  You will need to run 3-5 gallons of water through the water filter.  Discard the water  once you have done flushing the filter.  Consult your owner's manual for further information.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

If you remove the crispers and the pantry drawer the reservoir will be located behind them, There will be a couple of screws holding it in place.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Al, thank you for writing. The source of the leak could be due to either a faulty Primary Water Valve part PS11738512, Water Tube part PS11730901, or the Secondary Water Valve part PS2003637. We hope this helps."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Gerald, thank you for your question. From the symptoms, it looks like the fridge is getting too cold. The parts that can cause this problem are Thermistor (part number: PS2003772) and Damper Control Assembly (part number: PS11750106). Before replacing the tank it is recommended to turn off the water supply. We hope this helps, please feel free to contact our customer service if you need further assistance."

      {
        "customerQuestion": "Do you have a video or instructions on how to replace the water tank assembly?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Susan, thanks for the question. To replace the water tank assembly, you must remove the crisper and panty drawers, and the tank will be located behind them. You will need to remove the cover over the back where the tubing comes into it, to disconnect the tubes. The tank is held in the front by a couple of screws. Simply unscrew them and pull the tank out. To install the new one, reverse your steps. We always recommend turning off your water supply to the fridge before attempting this repair. Hope this helps!"

      {
        "customerQuestion": "If there are some small \"bits\" floating around in the water after dispensing from the fridge, does this mean I need to replace the water tank assembly?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jennifer, Thank you for the question. I suggest replacing the water filter first if it has not been replaced within the last 6 months. Also check the ice tray in the ice maker its self. The coating can wear off over time and get into the ice. You can check the water lines and then the tank. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

        "storyTitle": "Original bracket foot brake screw hole was stripped and foot brake would not extend",
        "repairInstruction": "The repair seemed simple, I just needed to remove the old bracket -- 4 screws -- and slip the new one on.The tricky bit is that the roller bracket holds the weight of the fridge. So in order to make sure that the fridge did not fall over, and to keep the installation point off the ground so that I could align the screw holes, I needed to shim up the side of the fridge that I was working on.To tap in the shims, I used a hammer and a spare chunk of wood. I ultimately used 3 shims, and kept tapping until the roller wheel could roll freely. Then I knew that the fridge was high enough. After that, it was pretty easy to remove the 4 screws, align the new bracket, and replace the screws. After that, in order to get the shims out I could just extend the foot brake as it was designed, and that lifted the fridge enough for me to easily slide out the shims. After that I just had to level out the fridge by adjusting the two feet. Read less"

The gasket had few rings that worked as place holder, although gaskets don't go bad often this model could be if it gets pulled alot and if motor assembly get pushed it will push up the gasket and cause a leak. Repair was simple, 1) take spray arm off from inside. 2) get under neath the dishwasher, take off wires so it would free up some room, pulled two plastic holder out, gently push the motor assembly up to the tub, 3) from inside the tub, pull up the assembly enough to get your hand under the gasket and pull them off. 4) Replace the gasket, align the assmebly and push down to snap in the gasket. 5) get under and push in two plastic clip back in, put wires back into its place. Back in the tub to push down the assembly again to make sure there are flush with surface. Put spray arm back on. Finished. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Stan, thank you for your question. There are two parts that you should check for this issue. The first part to test would be your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids that control either the dispenser or the ice maker. Even if your dispenser is working the ice maker solenoid may not be and vise versa. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. If that part is testing correctly then you should look into your ice maker being the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "The ice maker leaks water at the motor housing end? What is the solution?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dave,\nThank you for your question.  If the ice maker valve is leaking, check and make sure that the water line fittings are secure. If there is water leaking, check the fill cup to see if that is causing the issue.  If there is water leaking from the ice maker, a component in the water inlet valve may failed and you will need to test it to see if this is the problem. Unplug your refrigerator, disconnect the water supply and locate your water inlet valve. It is usually on the rear of the refrigerator, near the bottom. You will need to remove the rear panel to access it. Inspect the valve inlet supply connections for leaks and tighten or replace the connectors. You should also inspect the valve body for any cracks or damage. Check the outlet tubing for cracks or abrasions that may also create a leak and replace any cracked or brittle tubing and connectors. If none of the above appear to be the cause of the leak, remove the water inlet valve from the unit. Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, test your valve for continiuty by placing the probes on the valve’s terminals. You should receive a reading of 200 to 500 ohms. If you receive any other reading, you need a replacement water inlet valve.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

        "customerQuestion": "Water dispenses but ice machine does not work. What can be the issue? Fridge never had a line hooked to it.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Eric, thank you for asking! Prior to moving towards parts make sure the freezer temperature is -12C or below. If the temperature is above that you will need to clean the condenser coils and defrost the evaporator. Now check the water inlet valve (part number: PS3497634) and make sure the water pressure is not less than 20 psi. You can inspect the water inlet valve with a multimeter. If we are ok there, then the most probable cause is a faulty ice maker control assembly, part number PS2341896. If your ice maker control is defective it can no longer properly control the ice maker functions. It may not produce any ice, make small ice cubes, or have an intermittent operation.  Please contact customer service if you need assistance with purchase or repair. Thank you."

I did not want to part with it so I troubled shoot the system and realized that it could have been number of things so I just decided after reading some reviews here on this site I decided to just purchase the items tha t would be effecting the fridge not working properly which was the evaporator fan, defrost thermostat, defrost timer, temperature cold control thermostat, I also cleaned the condenser coils in the back of the unit so they can be able to withdraw heat from the unit. my repair and installation took about 4 hours due to the cleaning of the coils but now the fridge is working like brand new. thanks to this sitt and it's comprehensive video tutorials on installations and repair it my job a lot easier to do.this is not my first time ordering from this site and will not be my last. anyone considering ordering from this site do not hesitate there are great with parts and customer service.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi David,\nThank you for your question.  If the drain is clogged with debris, during the refrigerators defrost cycles, water will pool on the floor of the refrigerator and then freeze.  Once enough water has accumulated, it will leak out the front of the door.  If it is clogged, it will need to be cleaned out.  If the drain is leaking because it is cracked or damaged, then it will need to be replaced.  The part number listed under your model number for the drain tube is PS430889.  If you would like to place an order for it, you may order it either online or by calling our customer service line and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

I assumed a failed condenser fan, but the schematic shows no fan in the freezer compartment.  What else could it be?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ken,\nThank you for your question.  If the refrigerator is too warm, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the defrost timer, the cold control thermostat, the run capacitor, the evaporator fan motor and the fan blade. You will need to test the electronic parts with a multi-meter.  Here is a link to one of our videos on YouTube that you may use as a general reference on how to use one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWC44fHn0As. For more information on how to test these parts, click on the Appliance Repair link on our website and on the next page that comes up click on the microwave icon. When the next page comes up, you will be provided with a symptoms list.  Choose the \"Fridge and Freezer too warm\" symptom and the information will come up for you.  We hope this helps.

        "customerQuestion": "Would the defuseor leak and stop ref from cooling",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi William, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

First, we went online to your schematic on the unit. This showed how it was assembled and how it came apart. We then terminated the power to the refrigerator, and removed the drip tray which exposed two screws holding i n the face plate for the ice/water on the door of the refrigerator. We then removed three screws from the control panel and pulled it forward. This exposed the actuator and two more screws that held it into place. We removed them and unplugged the small plug giving power to the actuator. We then installed the new part and replaced all the screws that had been removed. We reassembled the face plate and the screws there and then snapped in the drip tray. When we turned on the power everything worked fine. Read less"

There are 4 locking tabs that secure the kickplate to the bottom of the refrigerator.  You will need to flex the kickplate so you can get an opening.

Once the kickplate has been removed, you will need to turn the adjustment screw under the grill to adjust the roller.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

The new rack comes as a kit, which includes the 4 required dish rack wheels (Part # 6 in the diagram). One part (only) from the original dish rack needs to be removed and re-installed on the new rack - the upper spray arm tower ( Part #5 in the diagram). That is easily removed from the original rack with a 1/8 counterclockwise turn, to disengage the 'feet', and installed on the new rack with a 1/8 clockwise turn. The kit is designed to allow for use on multiple models, so there are 'extra' parts left over, after it is used for the DU8500XX-2 dishwasher. These can be discarded. Read less"

For the upper dishrack the rack does not come assembled. This is a replacement rack for some models. If you do not have an adjustable rack you will need to transfer the rollers off the old rack to the new one. The adjustable rollers will not let the manifold align with the rear feed tube. I hope this helps."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi James, Thank you for the question. To install this power cord you will need to turn off the water and unplug the appliance. You will then need to remove the front bottom kick plate panel to expose the water valve to remove the fill hose from the valve and the drain hose. You will then need to remove the screws at the top front that mount the dishwasher from the counter top. Then you can adjust the leveling legs to a lower position ans pull the appliance out to gain access to the back of the appliance. At the bottom corner you will see a box held closed by a screw. Open up the box and disconnect the wiring for the power cord. There is a washer with tabs around the hole for the power cord wiring. You can loosen it by pushing the tabs with a flat head screw driver and then unscrew it completely. Once the washer is removed you can pull the power cord out from the hole at the back of the box. Insert  the new cord through the hole and reattach the washer with tabs. Reattach the wiring and close up the box. Reverse the steps for the hoses and mounting the appliance. Hope this helps!"

If you haven't already done so, you may want to look into a surge protector for your appliances. We hope this helps."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mitchell, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "repairInstruction": "There was an accidental spill which seeped through the water-hose feed hole in the bottom of the fridge. The liquid had dripped down onto the Starter and Run Capacitor and shorted them out. I called an applicance repair shop to possibly get it fixed. They estimated around $500 with the service call, parts and labor. Not a chance was they getting that from me. So I unhooked the retaining wired and removed the burnt parts. I then looked up the part numbers and ordered the 2 parts I needed from Parts Select for $50 bucks including shipping. In just two days my order arrived. I installed the 2 parts the same way and as easily as I took them out. Now my fridge is running good as new. When my HUSBAND returned home from work he was stunned to see that I had done the repair without his help. He laughed and said, \"Yep. You da' woman!\"Mrs. S.Queens, NY Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "How often should the ice machine blade be changed?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Cynthia, thank you for contacting us. Changing the ice blades depends on the conditions of the blades and has no defined period. Usually, it takes 6 months to two years to get the blade rusty. When you use rusty blades, it can actually make the ice unsafe for consumption. So, when you are starting to notice a difference in the consistency of your ice it’s definitely time to replace your blade. The best practice is to replace the blade once a year. We look forward to hearing from you if you need assistance with placing an order through our 7-days-a-week customer service. We hope this helps!"

        "storyTitle": "The dryer belt broke. During the effort to replace the belt it was noted that the lint trap housing seals were in need of replacement.",
        "repairInstruction": "With the dryer taken apart to replace the broken belt it was obvious that the lint seals had not been working properly due to the excessive amount of lint covering all of the inside surfaces of the dryer. The belt idler pully had also moved from its normal mounting position and was laying at the bottom of the dryer. Because the lint had c overed the bottom before the belt broke it was obvious to determine where the idler pully attached to the bottom.Before cleaning I marked the exact location where the idler pully mounted to the bottom of the dryer.While waiting for the replacement parts to be delivered a vacuum cleaner was used to remove lint from the inside surfaces of the dryer as well as the old fragments of the lint trap housing seals were removed and surfaces where the new seals would attach were cleaned.Assembling the dryer with the new belt was a challenge due to the lack of support for the drum while getting the new belt in place, lined up properly, threaded through the idler pully and attached to the motor drive shaft. This is how I installed the new belt:I used a piece of wood wider than the sides of the dryer, drilled holes that allowed for a piece of cloths line rope to be looped through and used to support the door opening end of the drum. The drum was set on the seal and rollers at the back of the dryer.The temporary wood /rope hanger was placed at the front end of the dryer resting on the sides with the top of the dryer raised. The rope was adjusted until the drum rested on the back rollers and the rope like it would be positioned normally.The new belt was then gently installed under the temporary support rope and around the drum.The new belt had many kinks from shipping and was difficult to align with the location on the drum where it needs to ride so small strips of tape were temporarily used to hold the new belt in position until it could be fed through the idler pully and on to the drive shaft.Several small pieces of a cardboard box were used to shim under the idler pully to hold it in its proper location as well as to make the belt attachment to the drive shaft easier.With the belt attached, the temporary cardboard shims were removed from under the idler pully.The front of the dryer was attached .The temporary board and rope hanger was removed.The tape that had been placed over the new belt to hold it in proper alignment was removed as the drum was rotated slowly by hand to ensure that all tape was removed prior to closing the top of the dryer.The seals as well as the remainder of the dryer assembly was completed without any problems.The dryer ran well for its initial trial spin and has dried several loads of laundry since.Great parts and support Thankyou Read less"

Took no time to get it apart and replace roller kit and belt. What took the longest was getting in there and cleaning out probably 15 years worth of dirt and dust. If you have not opened your dryer up and d one this, 10/10 recommend, because in doing so i found that the motor was the real culprit. Once i opened it up more, especially cleaning around the blower fan and motor, i was half a day in. Put it all back together and got it running for two more loads before the motor quit. Replaced that and since the hard work was done, had it back in in half an hour and running great. Probably will need to redo the felt seal one day, but for now, i am calling it a win. This is my go to site for all things and i have been able to work on most of my major appliances and do it myself using the helpful information here. Read less"

First I very carefully ordered all parts possibly associated with this problem. Watched all videos available for this model. Could not find one at Parts Select that addressed this particular dryer. Model number was correct. Finally found YouTube video that addressed an \"Old Kenmore Wood Top\". It showed the correct way to remove the Heating Element unit. Also Parts Select never mentions that fuses and sensors are not \"polarized\". Very important info for a novice. But Google helped me with that. Heating Element is \"polarized\", very important not to cross wires. I did order a couple Heating Element Connection Wire Kits that were not needed for this repair. Got all parts replaced, put dryer back together, crossed my fingers and turned it on, so far it has been working really well. I chose to replace all the parts I did because of the dryers age, plus I am not familiar with multimeters. Didn't want to risk one old part messing up a new part. Thank you Parts Select.It is not a 2 hr. repair, but I worked slowly, didn't want to make any mistakes.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Justin, thanks for getting in touch. This sounds like it is the thermal fuse WP3392519, but before replacing it you should inspect and test it for visible damage or indication of faultiness. If the thermal fuse is open and not working, your next check should be the exhaust ducting, since it is the most common reason for a thermal fuse to malfunction. Please let us know if you have further questions."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Sandi, \n\nThat's a great question, you can use an multi meter and test the continuity of the fuse.If no current is detected, it means there's no continuity and the fuse is defective. \n\nGood luck with this repair."

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer will start drying the clothes, but then after a few minutes, the heating stops.  All the controls work - but the dryer seems to be only blowing room temperature air.  I have cleaned the duct inside the dryer, and through the duct from the dryer to outside. I read that if the fuse was blown that the dryer would not start.  Except for lack of heat throughout the cycle, the dryer thinks it is working just fine.  What is my next step?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Vickie, Thank you for the question. Normally with the Thermal Fuse the dryer would still run as normally but there will be no heat. So you would still have the appliance start and tumble but blow cold or room temperature air. If the fuse blows it just stops electricity going to the element its self not the appliance. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer is not heating but still runs. Checked the thermal fuse and its not that.What else could it be?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Margaret, Thank you for the question. If the Thermal Fuse has tested to be good, I suggest checking the High Limit Thermostat,PartSelect Number PS11741456.This hi-limit thermostat acts as as safety mechanism that keeps the dryer from overheating. Once the dryer temperature reaches a certain point, this piece will shut down power to the heating element. When defective it will not send power to the element in order for it to heat up to dry the clothes. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Alison, although there are a few causes to this issue, the most common one is the exhaust ducting. If there is too much heat trapped inside the ducting it will cause the thermal fuse to open. What you need to find is any air flow problems. Is there breakage or clogging in your duct? Is it too long? The next thing to check would be if the ducting has condensation or water in it, or if there are dryer sheets in the blower wheel. Lastly you can check the drum seal to see if it is malfunctioning. Best of luck!"

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer works just does heat up thinking thermal fuse  thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dave,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If your dryer is not heating the most common parts to fix the issue are the heating element, the thermal fuse, the thermal cut-off kit, the high limit thermostat, the heating element connection wire kit and the internal bias thermostat to name a few.  To verify which part is causing the issue, you will need a multimeter. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Where is the thermal fuse located",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Pete,\n\nThat's a great question. The thermal fuse is located on the blower fan housing. To get to that part you will need a few tools: a hex socket, a putty knife, a flat head screwdriver, and also a phillips screwdriver. Please make sure to disconnect power to your appliance before ever attempting any repair. First you will want to remove the top panel screws. Place your top panel safely out of the way. Then take a look at your control panel. Press in the tabs on either side to pop it out of place. Disconnect the wire harness and then remove the screws to be able to move your circuit board bracket out of the way. Then remove the screws on the control bracket up front. Now you will want to remove the screws from the lower panel at the bottom of your machine. You can just lift that part right out. After that you will want to disconnect the moisture sensor and door switch wire harnesses. One set of wires should be yellow while the other set are brown, white, and blue. Then you will want to remove the screws at the bottom and top of your front panel. There are two mounting screws on the inside of your door panel. There are on either side of the filter. Remove those as well to be able to pull off the front panel. You will then remove the lower bulkhead screws and only loose the top screws. Don't take those ones off fully. Also remove the screw holding the blower housing in place as well. Then lift the bulkhead off the top screws and set it aside. After that you will remove the dryer belt from the motor pulley and pulley. I would suggest taking a picture of how the belt is installed on your appliance. So that you can reinstall it the same way. Use the belt to help you lift out the drum. Now you will have access to the thermal fuse inside of your machine. You can remove that part by unplugging it and removing the screw. To get your drum back into place, align its rim with the two rear rollers. Then follows these steps backwards and you will be able to put your machine b"

It stopped functioning a couple of weeks ago and i could not find a part online that fixes that function.  The closest one i can find is the thermal fuse.  Is that the likely culprit or is there another one i should suspect?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Janice, thank you for getting in touch. The buzzer is located in the main control board for the dryer. You would need to replace the whole control board in order to replace the buzzer. Control board, part number: PS11746535 $211.87 Hope this helps!"

BTW, your customer service is excellent.Reviewed YouTube videos.Patience is required, take your time, take photos of the wires and also make a written wiring chart. This was the flaw in my planning. Reference the schematics f rom PartsSelect to number the controls. Do NOT use masking tape to identify the wires as they will have all stuck together by the time you go to reinstall them. Most difficult process was removing and identifying the numerous wires to the back panel. They have push connectors, but some were very difficult to remove. The people doing the \"how to\" videos no doubt had them partially released and that made it look easy. Examine the connectors before removing to identify how they are captured by the connector. A paper clip \"tool\" I made enabled me to release some of the capture lugs, but some were so tight, I had to use small needle-nose pliers to open up the lug to release the wire on the connector. When reinstalling, re-tighten those connectors.Replacing the parts was much easier than the wiring disconnect/reconnect process. I'm happy to report that replacing the rear bearing and the front 2 green and 2 white shim/bearings immediately and completely solved my problem. For about $150, I restored my dryer to \"like-new\" functionality and got a lot of satisfaction from doing it. The project took about 4 hours, which could have been reduced to 2 hours had I know about the clip release and wiring identification process.

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

Have you also checked or replaced your thermal fuse? You may also want to test your heating element electrical connection to make sure that is still good. It could also be your temperature switch that is giving you the issue as well. I hope that gives your some more avenues to check out. Good luck with your repair."

If that part is working, I would suggest then testing your high limit thermostat and your thermal limit as well. Those two parts that are directly on the housing for your heating element. It could just be that one or both of those parts have gone out. You can also test those two thermostats with your multi meter. They should both read 0 ohms when you test them. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If the timer is working on automatic dry and not on timed dry, it sounds like the timed dry option is the option that is frequently used when drying and it is worn out.

We suggest using turbine oil on the rollers, shafts, and idler pulley (just a few drops). This will help situate the parts, and should give them a longer life span. Best of luck with this repair."

The belt with this kit seems to be the same, but the rollers shown on this page show a different part number than the roller kit that comes up when I search for my particular model #.  Also, the noise that I hear is a screeching that seems to be coming from the rear of the dryer.  When I spin the drum counterclockwise manually, I can hear the noise. A google search comes up with the suggestion to replace drum bearings when hearing noises in the rear.  Is there a drum bearing part for this model?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Kirk, Thank you for the question. This kit will not work on your model number sorry. You will need to order the Multi Rib Belt - 92-1/4\", Part Number: PS346995 and the Rear Drum Support Roller Kit, Part Number: PS2162268. Your model dose not have the drum that requires a bearing.Your drum rides on the lip at the back of the appliance, on the lip there is a felt seal that prevents the noise you are hearing. I suggest replacing the Drum Felt Seal, Part Number: PS11740735. Hope this helps!"

You will need to check the drum support rollers, the roller shaft, the front glides, the idler pulley wheel and bearing and the belt.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

If anything in the maintenance kit was not working, you would either hear it squeaking or have a burning rubber smell. You can test your door switch and your thermistor with a multi-meter to see if either of those parts are not working. Good luck with your repair."

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer is making a terribly loud noise when I first turn it on. Is there a kit or something I should get for it? Ive been looking at your parts list and if I change the top drum bearing I think I will need the drum slide bearings. How many do I need and which ones should I order??? Are there any other parts I should order to stop the noise? Thanks for the help!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Nina, great question. Changing your front bearings would be your first step as worn ones can cause loud noises throughout the drying cycle. To change the upper bearings, you will need 2 of WE1M504 and 2 of WE1M1067. If you decide to also change the rear bearing which would be the second most common cause for the noise, the part would be WE25M40. Let us know if you have any further questions."

        "customerQuestion": "While drying it is making a squeaking noise that is coming and going like it maybe the belt squeaking",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Bobby,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. Your belt could be the issue. If it has worn down so much that maybe it is slipping against the pulley. However it is more likely that you will have to replace either your bearing slides or your pulley. I would check all of these parts to see which one of them are causing your problem. They are all physical parts, so when you look at them you should be able to determine which one is causing the problem for you. The belt and the slides would be parts that get worn down, the pulley is just something that you turn the wheel on and you will hear if it is making the squeaking noise. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "I bought and am currently replacing the rear bearings. Since the dryer is already pulled apart how can I tell if I should replace the front bearings or the support?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Calista, thanks for getting in touch. You will know to replace the front bearings or the support if you see any visible damage. Wear is normal, but if the parts are damaged in any way they should be replaced. I hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "The dryer is not drying loads in normal time. It is also making a noise as if something is flopping around inside as the drum turns. There is nothing in the dryer and it still makes the noise. What should I check and in what order.Thanks, Jim",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jim, Thank you for the question. You can check the belt to make sure it is not wore out and and preventing the drum to turn as it should.You can also check the Rear Drum Bearing for wear. Make sure the appliance is getting proper air flow. Clean the Lint Trap Duct Assembly and the Air Vents. You can use a Multi Meter to test the High Limit Thermostat and the Bias Thermostat as well for proper continuity. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "A question about dryer . Once in awhile durnh a drying cycle the dryer will make a squeaking noise.And sometimes the dryer will take a long time to dry but i found the front seal was broken and not fully there.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Juan,\nThank you for your question.  The squeaking noise you are hearing is likely a worn drum support roller that needs to be replaced.  It is always recommended to replace both of them at the same time.  If your dryer is taking a long time to dry and the front seal I would recommend replacing it as this is likely causing the issue.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Denny,\nThank you for your inquiry.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the drive belt, the idler pulley wheel, the complete duct trap assembly, the idler arm, the bearing retainer and the bearing slides.  I hope this helps.

How can i be sure of the exact replacement part, it looks the same.  And what about these after market parts; 1/3 the price. My washer has 2 pumps i focused on the drain motor, assuming the other would be ok.  Any thoughts?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Arnie,\n\nThank you for your question. There are three causes for the OE error code on your machine. Either there are blockages in your drain pump, your drain filter is clogged, or your drain hose is bent/blocked. I would suggest you check both your filter and hoses as well. I would not be able to comment on after market parts because we only deal in OEM parts. The second pump is just your circulation pump and does not have anything to do with your draining. It just makes sure that any suds inside of the drain tube leading from your drum get's cycled back into the cleaning process. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Put the machine back together, ran a rinse and spin cycle and it performed fine.  Ran the next load of laundry and it again came up with a code saying it could not drain again.  ***note, the drain motor was pretty loud while running after i had already drained the tub when checking for blockages.

I had to cut the old bower wheel out in pieces so I could remove the electric motor, which was easy. Once out and on the bench and only the metal hub left on the shaft a 7/16\" wrench and large vise-grips got it to break loose.

I could suggest first taking a look to see if your blower wheel is clogged up with lint. You should also check to see if your dryer duct is kinked or blocked as well. If all of venting and duct work is cleared out and fine, you may have to look at your motor being the issue. Good luck with your repair."

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

        "storyTitle": "The dryer belt broke. During the effort to replace the belt it was noted that the lint trap housing seals were in need of replacement.",
        "repairInstruction": "With the dryer taken apart to replace the broken belt it was obvious that the lint seals had not been working properly due to the excessive amount of lint covering all of the inside surfaces of the dryer. The belt idler pully had also moved from its normal mounting position and was laying at the bottom of the dryer. Because the lint had c overed the bottom before the belt broke it was obvious to determine where the idler pully attached to the bottom.Before cleaning I marked the exact location where the idler pully mounted to the bottom of the dryer.While waiting for the replacement parts to be delivered a vacuum cleaner was used to remove lint from the inside surfaces of the dryer as well as the old fragments of the lint trap housing seals were removed and surfaces where the new seals would attach were cleaned.Assembling the dryer with the new belt was a challenge due to the lack of support for the drum while getting the new belt in place, lined up properly, threaded through the idler pully and attached to the motor drive shaft. This is how I installed the new belt:I used a piece of wood wider than the sides of the dryer, drilled holes that allowed for a piece of cloths line rope to be looped through and used to support the door opening end of the drum. The drum was set on the seal and rollers at the back of the dryer.The temporary wood /rope hanger was placed at the front end of the dryer resting on the sides with the top of the dryer raised. The rope was adjusted until the drum rested on the back rollers and the rope like it would be positioned normally.The new belt was then gently installed under the temporary support rope and around the drum.The new belt had many kinks from shipping and was difficult to align with the location on the drum where it needs to ride so small strips of tape were temporarily used to hold the new belt in position until it could be fed through the idler pully and on to the drive shaft.Several small pieces of a cardboard box were used to shim under the idler pully to hold it in its proper location as well as to make the belt attachment to the drive shaft easier.With the belt attached, the temporary cardboard shims were removed from under the idler pully.The front of the dryer was attached .The temporary board and rope hanger was removed.The tape that had been placed over the new belt to hold it in proper alignment was removed as the drum was rotated slowly by hand to ensure that all tape was removed prior to closing the top of the dryer.The seals as well as the remainder of the dryer assembly was completed without any problems.The dryer ran well for its initial trial spin and has dried several loads of laundry since.Great parts and support Thankyou Read less"

If you have not opened your dryer up and d one this, 10/10 recommend, because in doing so i found that the motor was the real culprit. Once i opened it up more, especially cleaning around the blower fan and motor, i was half a day in. Put it all back together and got it running for two more loads before the motor quit. Replaced that and since the hard work was done, had it back in in half an hour and running great. Probably will need to redo the felt seal one day, but for now, i am calling it a win.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ron,\n\nThank you for your question. It sounds like you either have a motor issue or there is a build up of lint inside of your blower parts. I could suggest first taking a look to see if your blower wheel is clogged up with lint. You should also check to see if your dryer duct is kinked or blocked as well. If all of venting and duct work is cleared out and fine, you may have to look at your motor being the issue. Good luck with your repair."

When I emailed customer service to complain, I never received any response. I can't believe that customer service can be so unimportant in such a competitive marketplace. And with the power of social media, you would think customer service would be a big differentiator.I ended having to buy another part (the igniter). I found a different vendor with better prices and a commitment to satisfying customers. I got my part in 3 days for cheaper shipping than the starting point of Parts Select shipping. So I guess I should thank Parts Select for forcing me to look elsewhere because I found a better place with better prices and better shipping and better customer service! Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Gavin, thank you for your question. Yes, the correct belt that the manufacturer recommends for your specific appliance model is part number Drive Belt 661570V. I don't believe they count the first rib when giving description of the belt. Either way, per you model information this is the right belt and will work with your unit. The lint screen foam seal is part number Seal, Outlet Housing part number WP697813. This is a specific piece of foam material that is made specifically for dryers, and should be used for this repair. It is made of a heat resistant material. I hope this helps!"

Also, the new screws were Philips drive and due to the amount of torque trying to self tap nearly stripped them out. The old sharper screws were square drive which had a better bite. So basically, I used the old screws to self tap and then used the new screws for the final installation. It took a long time to clean all the lint out from the inside of the dryer. The motor was completely embedded with lint and animal hair. You may want to suggest that a good cleaning may be needed so bring a shop vac...and also something to carefully pick the lint balls out from around the motor armature and bearing area.

The first parts to check in this case would be all of your thermostats and thermal fuses. You can test those parts with a multi meter and they should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. If those parts are fine, you should then go on to testing your heating element as well. You can also test that with a multi meter and it should be reading  between 0 - 50 ohms. Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "storyTitle": "Dryer would struggle to start, but never run.",
        "repairInstruction": "When this dryer was given to me, I was told the door switch was going bad. It was originally purchased in 1996 as a REAL MAYTAG, so fixing it was no brainer, but the switch did not fix the problem. I pulled the small panel off the back to expose the motor and struggled to spin it by hand, so I assumed the motor was seizing up. r />I entered the model number into this website and found a motor that would work and also decided to go with a belt and a fan. There was an installation video provided when I added the motor to my cart. The dryer was older than mine, but obviously identical on the interior. The only difference was that older dryer didn't have a little deflector shield that I have and I still can't remember where that goes. My dryer appears to be working just fine without it though. Like the video stated:Remove two screws at the bottom of the front panel to remove the panel while disconnecting the door switch wires. Since I had an old switch, I took the three wires and plugged them into that so I would remember where each one went . I believe after that was the fan housing with a few bolts, then the drum. I reached through the small back panel to loosen the belt by moving the tensioner back, then removing the drum. The fan was secured by a snap ring and a spring loaded hose clamp that required a small set of pliers. There were two bolts that held the motor in; once removed, the motor slid out with the bracket. The tough part was using the screwdriver to get the clamps off that hold the motor to the bracket, but the video helped with that. The new motor did not come with instructions on how to wire it, so I had to go to this site and find somebody who had asked the question. The video did not do all that great a job in showing me where the wires go and since the motor was different than my REAL MAYTAG motor, I had no idea where the wires went, but I found someone who asked the question and he got the answer, so I was able to figure it out. It had been over a month since I had taken the dryer apart so I went back to that video which, except for the wiring and that tiny little deflector plate, provided excellent detail of how to install everything. I had trouble deciding where I wanted the wires to make sure the drum didn't rub on them, so after it was all back together, I watched the drum rotate with the dryer running from that little panel in the back. One thing that saved me was every time I took something off, I kept the bolts with that item. It only became a problem when my friend came over and saw the dryer in pieces. He just had to give me his own lecture about fixing dryers and when he talks he has touch everything, so all my bolts are going flying! I was like, \"What are you doing? Are you gonna put this back together for me after you lose all my bolts?\" Read less"

I checked the low limit fuse with an ohm meter and it had continuity. When I checked the High limit fuse it did not, there was infinite resistance meaning it was open and not providing current to the heater ele ments. Out of concern why the high limit blew, I decided to replace the thermostat as well. As I dissembled the dryer there was an over abundance of lint from years of use. I also notice the drum belt had some chunks missing and decided to replace it since I was removing it anyway. Ordered the parts from Part Select and they arrived in a timely manner as promised. Replaced the defective parts, vacuumed out all the lint and junk that was coating the drive motor and other items.

        "storyTitle": "dryer made squeaking noise when first starting to run",
        "repairInstruction": "I first watched the video and disassembled the dryer to see if I could determine what part was squeaking. All looked good except the wheel on the Idler lever which was tight. I vacuumed up the years of lint and reassembled the dryer and waited for the parts to arrive. I ordered the idler lever and also the 2 drum support wheels, belt and 2 drum guides since I thought that is was a good idea to go ahead and replace these parts once I had the dryer disassembled again. Good choice on the belt as once I removed the old belt there was a crack on the underside of the belt. I bought snap ring pliers at home depot but the tips were too big to fit the holes on the snap rings on the drum rollers. I bought another snap ring plier set from an automotive store that came wth 5 snap ring attachments - but again all were too large to fit the snap rings on the drum support rollers. I used a nail and small screwdriver to expand and pull off the snap rings but this approach was frustrating and time consuming. Not sure where to get snap ring pliers that are small enough to fit the holes on the snap rings - so hope that you have better luck locating a set thats small enough! I was able to return the pliers that I purchased - so all good. I was surprised at how easy the dryer came apart and how easy it was easy to work on. When disassembling the dryer - we took pictures of the wire connections before we disconnected them, however at one point we tilted the dryer back to clean behind it and the top slipped a little away from the side panel of the dryer and one of the wires that was connect to the wire block that is up by where the power cord connects cam loose - and it took some time to find and figure out a wiring diagram for this connection. Suggest that you take a pictire of this wire connection block once you lift the lid - just in case a slip occurs and a wire may disconnect. When replacing the idler lever - have a little grease available when you install the new idler lever (between the arm and the bolt area as it constantly moves and the old brease has probably worn away) . After making these repairs I dont think I will ever buy a new dryer as any part , including the heater and motor would be easy to replace and cheaper than a new dryer. Read less"

If you have an electric dryer you will need to check the heating element, the high limit thermostat and the cycling thermostat.  If you have a gas dryer you will need to check the igniter, the radiant flame sensor, the gas control valve and the coils.  There are some other parts you will need to check as well.  They are the temperature sensor, the timer and the thermal fuse. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Mike,\n\nThanks for your question. A bad squealing noise is typically due to bad rollers or the idler pulley. Inspect the rollers and the pulley for any signs of wear or damage visually and replace them if they are damaged.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mario, thank you for your question. When you are experiencing an issue like this there are a few parts that you will have to test to determine what is causing your issue. For all of these parts you can test them with a multi meter. First you will have to test your thermostats and thermal fuses to make sure they are all functioning correctly. After that you will want to test parts in this order, your m series coils, igniter itself, or your radiant flame sensor. You may also want to check your regulator just to make sure that part is functioning properly as well.  Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

It could be that the belt was installed with the grooves facing out which is allowing it to slide on the drum. However, the most likely cause would be a lack of tension on the belt. I would recommend double checking the belt path and that the idler is installed correctly and providing tension on the belt. \n\nI hope this helps!"

Did them again because they were worn in half again but this time I added the 2 roller kits and the belt, really just guessing. I was surprised how full of dust and lint the inside was, especially the blower fan blades. I ordered the sc rew because the belt idler pulley assembly was very wobbly and I hoped that was the screw anchoring it to the motor housing was the problem but it wasn't. Turns out the threaded hole in the housing was stripped, due I guess to years of vibration. It was too tight to get a tap and dye in there so I drilled the hole out and replaced the screw with a bolt and nut and lock washer. Before drilling it out I tried a few strands of wire and JB Weld, like the trick with stripped wood holes where you break off toothpicks in the hole and fill with wood glue. But that stripped out too so I drilled and used the bolt. Turned out I didn't need that $7 screw. Probably should have known comparing it to the old one which looked the same after I cleaned it.

It sounds like the dryer drum is struggling to spin, but it is still spinning.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Louis, we recommend checking the rollers for the problem you are experiencing. Rollers are a commonly replaced part because they do wear down over time. The most common side effect of worn rollers are loud screeching noises. If not the rollers, the next step would be to check the blower wheel to make sure it is not broken. I hope this helps!"

As it happens the felt seals looked find and there were foreign objects so, not wanting to disassemble and reassemble the dryer more than I had, I ended up replac ing all the replaceable moving parts that I considered possible culprits: The idler tension spring, the idler tension bracket (which includes a nylon pulley wheel), the drum belt, the five rubber-tipped bearings that support the drum and keep it in place, and the foam seal on the blower housing which seemed a little brittle and old, as well as high-temperature adhesive for the latter. The instructional videos here and on YouTube were extremely helpful (I doubt that I would have attempted this job at all, had I not watched these ahead of time). The most time-consuming aspect was waiting for the arrival of the parts as I didn't order them all at the same time or all from the same place (I ordered from whomever could ship me a given part the fastest. Disassembly took less than an hour. Re-assembly with the new parts in place took about the same but was a little more awkward because this appliance sits in a very narrow closet and it's difficult to ensure that the 4\" flexible duct stays in place when sliding the appliance back into the closet. No regrets.

        "repairInstruction": "After viewing many instructions on how to replace a broken drum drive belt on UTUBE and the video you sent me the project was completed with no problems and with ease. However, I did discover large amounts of lint caked to the bottom of the lint screen housing just beyond the filter screen. There was minimal lint on the lint exhaust fan blades and no lint in the exhaust ducts.I didn't recall seeing any video instructions drawing attention to potential lint issues, it just made good sense to clean the entire system while it was apart . At first I saw no major lint problem.However, after removing the lint screen and placing a vacuum cleaner wand to the bottom of the lint screen housing (the bottom is not easy to see) my vacuum cleaner hose became clogged three times. I realized there was a major lint issue isolated to this area.Many of the on line complaints focused on parts not properly fitting their dryer. they had to modify the parts in some way to fit or operate or they had to return them for other parts. Just think of the time wasted and the lack of use of their dryer.I called and talked to a tech. Gave them my model number and the tech located the correct OEM parts for my dryer. I paid the extra money for OEM parts because I wanted my dryer fixed and restored to service in the least amount of time.Outside the discovery of the not so obvious lint issue, the repair project was easy and the dryer was restored to full service with minimal down time.Thanks for all your help and fast delivery service.

The belt is usually installed around the drum first, then you would pinch your belt together near the bottom, lift your idler pulley up and place the ribbed part of the belt around the motor pulley. Then you press your idler pulley down on to the belt to get your tension. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

First I very carefully ordered all parts possibly associated with this problem. Watched all videos available for this model. Could not find one at Parts Select that addressed this particular dryer. Model number was correct. Finally found YouTube video that addressed an \"Old Kenmore Wood Top\". It showed the correct way to remove the Heating Element unit. Also Parts Select never mentions that fuses and sensors are not \"polarized\". Very important info for a novice. But Google helped me with that. Heating Element is \"polarized\", very important not to cross wires. I did order a couple Heating Element Connection Wire Kits that were not needed for this repair. Got all parts replaced, put dryer back together, crossed my fingers and turned it on, so far it has been working really well. I chose to replace all the parts I did because of the dryers age, plus I am not familiar with multimeters. Didn't want to risk one old part messing up a new part. Thank you Parts Select.It is not a 2 hr. repair, but I worked slowly, didn't want to make any mistakes.

This sounds like it is the thermal fuse WP3392519, but before replacing it you should inspect and test it for visible damage or indication of faultiness. If the thermal fuse is open and not working, your next check should be the exhaust ducting, since it is the most common reason for a thermal fuse to malfunction.

I read that if the fuse was blown that the dryer would not start.  Except for lack of heat throughout the cycle, the dryer thinks it is working just fine.  What is my next step?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Vickie, Thank you for the question. Normally with the Thermal Fuse the dryer would still run as normally but there will be no heat. So you would still have the appliance start and tumble but blow cold or room temperature air. If the fuse blows it just stops electricity going to the element its self not the appliance.

If the Thermal Fuse has tested to be good, I suggest checking the High Limit Thermostat,PartSelect Number PS11741456.This hi-limit thermostat acts as as safety mechanism that keeps the dryer from overheating. Once the dryer temperature reaches a certain point, this piece will shut down power to the heating element. When defective it will not send power to the element in order for it to heat up to dry the clothes. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Alison, although there are a few causes to this issue, the most common one is the exhaust ducting. If there is too much heat trapped inside the ducting it will cause the thermal fuse to open. What you need to find is any air flow problems. Is there breakage or clogging in your duct? Is it too long? The next thing to check would be if the ducting has condensation or water in it, or if there are dryer sheets in the blower wheel. Lastly you can check the drum seal to see if it is malfunctioning. Best of luck!"

If your dryer is not heating the most common parts to fix the issue are the heating element, the thermal fuse, the thermal cut-off kit, the high limit thermostat, the heating element connection wire kit and the internal bias thermostat to name a few.  To verify which part is causing the issue, you will need a multimeter. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Please make sure to disconnect power to your appliance before ever attempting any repair. First you will want to remove the top panel screws. Place your top panel safely out of the way. Then take a look at your control panel. Press in the tabs on either side to pop it out of place. Disconnect the wire harness and then remove the screws to be able to move your circuit board bracket out of the way. Then remove the screws on the control bracket up front. Now you will want to remove the screws from the lower panel at the bottom of your machine. You can just lift that part right out. After that you will want to disconnect the moisture sensor and door switch wire harnesses. One set of wires should be yellow while the other set are brown, white, and blue. Then you will want to remove the screws at the bottom and top of your front panel. There are two mounting screws on the inside of your door panel. There are on either side of the filter. Remove those as well to be able to pull off the front panel. You will then remove the lower bulkhead screws and only loose the top screws. Don't take those ones off fully. Also remove the screw holding the blower housing in place as well. Then lift the bulkhead off the top screws and set it aside. After that you will remove the dryer belt from the motor pulley and pulley. I would suggest taking a picture of how the belt is installed on your appliance. So that you can reinstall it the same way. Use the belt to help you lift out the drum. Now you will have access to the thermal fuse inside of your machine. You can remove that part by unplugging it and removing the screw. To get your drum back into place, align its rim with the two rear rollers. Then follows these steps backwards and you will be able to put your machine b"

First I very carefully ordered all parts possibly associated with this problem. Watched all videos available for this model. Could not find one at Parts Select that addressed this particular dryer. Model number was correct. Finally found YouTube video that addressed an \"Old Kenmore Wood Top\". It showed the correct way to remove the Heating Element unit. Also Parts Select never mentions that fuses and sensors are not \"polarized\". Very important info for a novice. But Google helped me with that. Heating Element is \"polarized\", very important not to cross wires. I did order a couple Heating Element Connection Wire Kits that were not needed for this repair. Got all parts replaced, put dryer back together, crossed my fingers and turned it on, so far it has been working really well. I chose to replace all the parts I did because of the dryers age, plus I am not familiar with multimeters. Didn't want to risk one old part messing up a new part. Thank you Parts Select.It is not a 2 hr. repair, but I worked slowly, didn't want to make any mistakes.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dylan, we recommend testing the temperature coming from the dryer when on high heat, which should be about 110 (low end) to 160 (high end) degrees. If your dryer is cycling before it hits the 150 degrees, you most likely have a faulty cycling thermostat. This can be tested with a multi-meter with temperature. Best of luck with this repair!"

This thermostat is in tune with the temperature of your dryer and regulates it in order to maintain a certain temperature. This thermostat reaches a temperature of 155 degrees, turns off, and then turns on again once it has dropped by 25 degrees. If the thermostat isn't turning off, the unit will overheat and the fuse will blow. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Danny, thank you for contacting us. It does not sound like an issue with the motor. It sounds like it would be the timer. The dryer timer is used to control the unit's cycles by regulating the length of time that power is directed to each setting. If it becomes faulty it could cause nothing to happen when you start a cycle or only work on certain cycles. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Okay, i have now replaced thermal fuse and internal bias thermostat. Dryer runs with much heat and shuts off as expected, at end of cycle. Just for diagnostic purposes, i ran the dryer on the air only cycle/no heat. However, the dryer still producing heat. Is this normal? I suspect it is not, do i need to replace other parts as well. Thank you for your help. All the symptoms i was viewing were describing no heat, and it appears as if i have too much heat. Thanks again.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Steve, thank you for your question. I would recommend replacing the Thermal Cut-Off Kit part number 279816. The thermal cut-off turns off the heating component when the dryer overheats, ensuring there is a consistent level of heat at all times. If the unit isn't cycling off properly, the unit will get too hot. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dion,\n\nThank you for the great question. The first part we suggest you replace is the Thermal Fuse. This thermal fuse is designed for use in dryers. It is a safety mechanism that stops the flow of electricity to the heating element when a dryer overheats. When this fuse is faulty, your dryer will not start or it will not heat properly and shuts off to soon. This is a one-time fuse, meaning it cannot be re-set, It must be replaced.\n\nHope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "What is wiring order for this repair?",

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Larry,\n\nThanks for your question. You will want a multimeter to test a few different internal parts. Replace any that do not show electrical continuity. Also be sure to clean out the venting if that is clogged. Test the internal-bias thermostat, the thermal fuse, the high-limit thermostat, and the heating element. Visually inspect the belt as well for any signs of wear and tear.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "customerQuestion": "I have an Admiral electric dryer, aed4475tq1.  Lately on autodry, it mostly dries the cloths but then i have to use the 20 30 time dry to finish drying the cloths.  Basically, the dryer is shutting off just a little too early on autodry.  I don't think this dryer has a moisture sensor to clean.  Ventilation is good and there is no build up of lint internally or on the filter.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Brian, thank you for your question. The issue is most likely with a thermostat. There are a few thermostats in the unit. With a multimeter, these parts can be tested very easily. The parts you will want to check are Thermostat, Internal-Bias Part Number: WP3387134, Thermal Cut-Off Kit Part Number: 279816 and Thermostat, High Limit 221 F ( Part Number: WP3977767. Set your multimeter to the R X 1 setting. Take each of your meter's probes and touch one to each terminal. You are testing for continuity, and you should receive a reading of either zero or infinity. At room temperature, testing the thermostat should produce a reading of zero. But if a thermostat is tested when it is heated to its limit, a reading of infinity should be produced. We strongly recommend that you test your thermostat at room temperature. If the test you conduct with your thermostat does not produce these results, then you should replace the component. I hope this helps. Thank you and have a great day!"

Before buying the parts, I had already taken my machine apart to clean it and check for lint build up, but there was only a bit of dust, no major blockages. Because the burning smell was metallic, I just had my fingers crossed that replacing t he heating element and thermostat would do the trick. It worked! There is an odd ceramic sort of smell in the first 5 minutes of using the new element but that went away and all is working well at this point. My components looked slightly different from those on the video; I had fewer wires so I just took photos of everything before I started to make sure I put it all back in the correct place. I had to watch another video on how to easily remove the thermostat, mine was stuck. I just used a flat head screw driver behind it like a lever and gently pried it off.It took me about 30 minutes total only because I had to watch a couple of extra YouTube videos due to the differences of my machine. I donât usually do repairs like this one and wanted to be completely sure I was doing it correctly, but the work/repair itself was super easy. The lint trap seal was just because mine got damaged when I took it apart to clean it. I just pulled the old one off, made sure the old adhesive was completely removed, (it peeled off like scotch tape), I cleaned it, then I slowly went around the edge of the vent/housing and stuck the new foam seal down.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jessica,\nThank you for your question.  The part you removed from your dryer, part number 3977393, is part of a thermal cut-off kit.  The thermal cut-off turns off the heating component when the dryer overheats, ensuring there is a consistent level of heat at all times. This dryer thermal cut-off kit includes one high-limit thermostat with a limit of 250 degrees Fahrenheit, and one thermal cut-off fuse (309 degrees). This kit also includes flat heaters with jumper wires. If your dryer is not starting properly, shutting off too soon or is taking too long to dry your clothes it could be because it has blown and needs to be replaced. This would be the part you would need to replace and you would replace both parts at the same time.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

First I very carefully ordered all parts possibly associated with this problem. Watched all videos available for this model. Could not find one at Parts Select that addressed this particular dryer. Model number was correct. Finally found YouTube video that addressed an \"Old Kenmore Wood Top\". It showed the correct way to remove the Heating Element unit. Also Parts Select never mentions that fuses and sensors are not \"polarized\". Very important info for a novice. But Google helped me with that. Heating Element is \"polarized\", very important not to cross wires. I did order a couple Heating Element Connection Wire Kits that were not needed for this repair. Got all parts replaced, put dryer back together, crossed my fingers and turned it on, so far it has been working really well. I chose to replace all the parts I did because of the dryers age, plus I am not familiar with multimeters. Didn't want to risk one old part messing up a new part. Thank you Parts Select.It is not a 2 hr. repair, but I worked slowly, didn't want to make any mistakes. It would be good if everyone is aware of some of the above information and the YouTube video done by an individual on this particular dryer. Read less"

Installation of the parts we ordered was simple...and we w ould be considered novice installers....really great website and easy to understand. Customer service was excellent as well. After installation of the parts, still no heat and heating element was registering only 120v. We checked everything again and found that the dryer plug was not all the way in the socket. Probably came loose with the move to the petestal.....plugged it in securely and it works great now. Should have checked that first, but because it was running we just didn't think of checking it. Good lesson learned and so glad we found this website. We will definately be using this site again and telling everyone we know about how great you guys are!

Could this be the heating element or is there another part that could be faulty? This is the first time my dryer has not worked since 2005.  Thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Anthony, thank you for your question. The first thing you will want to do is vacuum the inside of the unit around the element, the tumbler, the motor and the ducting. If there are not obstructions, and the unit continues to not heat. You will want to check the thermostats. There are a couple of them on the unit; Thermal Fuse Part Number: WP3392519, High Limit Thermostat and Thermal Fuse Kit Part Number: 279973, Thermostat, Internal-Bias Part Number: WP8577274, and the \t\nHigh Limit Thermostat - L295-50F Part Number: WP3391914. These can all be tested with a multimeter. Use a multimeter to test the thermostat's resistance by setting it to the RX 1 setting.\nPlace each of the meter's probes onto the wire terminals. You should receive a reading of 0. Resistance that is low, or near 0, means that the electrical flow is good and the part does not need to be replaced. If the thermostats test as being in good condition and working properly, the element would be the issue. I hope this helps!"

I watched heating element switch on and off when on low setting.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dan, Thank you for the question. If both the High Limit Thermostat and Thermal Fuse were replaced at the same time, I suggest testing the Thermostat, Internal-Bias Part Number, PS11746740 and the Thermal Fuse, Part Number: PS11741460. These parts are located on the blower housing and can be tested with a multi meter. They should be replaced at the same time.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ken, thank you for inquiring. Too much heat can indicate a defective Thermal Fuse part PS11741460 for your model. It could also be either the Internal-Bias Thermostat part PS11746740 or the High Limit Thermostat and Thermal Cut-Off Kit part PS334387 for your model. The other piece you are referring to is only sold as a part of the Console for your unit. Unfortunately the Console is discontinued and is no longer available. We have no known replacement information in our system. We recommend you contact Whirlpool  directly to see if they have recently released a new substitute. Please feel free to get back in touch with us to place an order if they provide a substitution part number. Thank you."

        "customerQuestion": "My 4 1/2 year old Maytag dryer is not heating at all. I have had the vent checked and it is clear. I had an appliance repair guy out and he said he tested all the usual parts (fuses etc) and they all were good. He now says it has to be the mother board, which seems out of line for a 4 year old dryer. Could he be right?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Marsha,\nThank you for your question.  If the technician you hired tested the usual parts and they checked out fine, it is possible that the electronic control board may be the issue. To verify if it is the part causing the issue, you will need to test the parts with a multimeter.  Here is a link to one of our videos on YouTube that you may reference on how to use one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWC44fHn0As. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

This error code can sometimes be caused by a glitch or power surge through the electrical lines. You may be able to clear this code by unplugging the washer for 5 minutes.  Be sure to unplug the washer before accessing internal components.  If this does not help you will need to replace the electronic control board.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Good afternoon.  My dryer would not start (although the lights came on) so I replaced the thermal fuse (WP3392519).  The dryer started and worked for a day, then, as above would not start again.  I checked the resistance on the fuse - there was no connectivity.  There are no obstructions in the unit or the exit hose / vent.  It was suggested that I replace the thermal cutoff with 279973. Prior to doing so, I tested the connectivity on the two parts.  Both showed connectivity except when I heated the thermostat in an electric skillet.  If 'clicked' off at 280 degrees Celsius.  I have not checked the other part included in 279973 (another thermal fuse?) other than to verify that it has zero ohms of resistance.  Not sure what else to check prior to replacing the 279973; however, the thermal cutoff is good, I would rather not spend the $50.  Help?  Next steps?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Richard,\nThank you for your question.  If you have not checked the other thermal fuse, I would check it with a multimeter to verify if it is working correctly.  If the dryer is not starting there are some other parts you should also check as well to see if they are causing the issue.  I would also check the door switch, the start switch, the motor, the electronic control board and the terminal block.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

One way to see if your dryer's air vent is clogged is by turning on your dryer and going outside to feel the flow of air leaving the vent. If it is slow and not very warm, your vent may be due for a good cleaning. If this does not help, we would recommend checking the dryer safety thermostat, part number PS12073908, it is acting as a thermal switch. It shuts off the heating element when the dryer overheats. We hope this sorts out your problem!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jim, thank you for the question. The part 506 on the diagram is the high limit thermostat, part number PS11772030. Thermostat with part number WE04X26139 and partselect number PS12073908 is 507 on the diagram. It could be faulty also, we would recommend checking it using a multimeter. Remove the wires by pulling on the connectors, and not the wires themselves. It may be a good idea to use a pair of needle-nosed pliers to help you. Set your multimeter to the R X 1 setting. Take each of your meter's probes and touch one to each terminal. You are testing for continuity, and you should receive a reading of either zero or infinity. At room temperature, testing the thermostat should produce a reading of zero. But if a thermostat is tested when it is heated to its limit, a reading of infinity should be produced. We strongly recommend that you test your thermostat at room temperature. If the test you conduct with your thermostat does not produce these results, then you should replace the component. We hope this information is useful!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Gerry,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The thermostats that are listed under your model number are designed to work with your appliance.  There is a high limit kit listed under your model number, part number PS2162282.  The high limit kit comes with three separate thermal fuses for dryers. One electric thermal fuse with a limit of 258, one gas high limit at 240, and one gas and electric high limit thermostat with a limit at 300. The thermal fuse kit shuts off the motor in the dryer when it begins to overheat. If the dryer will not heat, is overheated, shuts off too soon, or takes too long to dry then the thermal fuse might have exploded and need to be replaced. For replacement instructions refer to the diagram by manufacturer. For safety, unplug the dryer before installing the part.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "I suspect the thermal switch is bad. When i was looking at it, i noticed i could push in the back side of the switch. Is that normal ?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Boyd,\nThank you for your question.  To verify if the switch is bad, you will need to test it with a multimeter.  Disconnect the power source to your dryer before you conduct this or any other test. Either unplug the unit from the wall outlet, remove the appropriate fuse from the fuse box, or flip the appropriate breaker in the circuit breaker panel.\nYour dryer uses multiple thermostats to regulate its internal temperature. The cycle selected determines which thermostat is used. A cycling thermostat can be found somewhere in the path of air that is leaving the drum. It could be found on the blower wheel housing or inside the venting/exhaust system. Dryer thermostats are usually oval shaped and about an inch and a half in length. Also, there should be two wires leading to each thermostat. Label these wires before you remove them so that you are able to correctly reconnect them later.\n\nThe wires leading to the thermostat are connected using metal slip on connectors. Remove the wires by pulling on the connectors, and not the wires themselves. It may be a good idea to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you.\n\nSet your multimeter to the R X 1 setting. Take each of your meter's probes and touch one to each terminal. You are testing for continuity, and you should receive a reading of either zero or infinity. At room temperature, testing the thermostat should produce a reading of zero. But if a thermostat is tested when it is heated to its limit, a reading of infinity should be produced. We strongly recommend that you test your thermostat at room temperature.  If the test you conduct with your thermostat does not produce these results, then you should replace the component.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Can i replace the thermostat(125f-31f) and thermal fuse (140f-35f) with american parts.  How much can i vary from these temperatures and differentials.  As i understand it the thermostat can vary from 125-94, 31 being the differential and the same goes for the fuse.  Where can i find them where the specs are shown.  Most of the sites on show the thermastat specs but not the fuse.  Can anyone help.  If you want to reply my email is jsanchez1dad@yahoo.Com  thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jaime, Thank you for contacting us. I am sorry however I am not able to find any concrete information to advise whether or not you are able to interchange the parts, as often different countries have different safety standards. I suggest reaching out to a local technician or Asko directly. Good luck with your repair. Have a wonderful day!"

Also, the noise that I hear is a screeching that seems to be coming from the rear of the dryer.  When I spin the drum counterclockwise manually, I can hear the noise. A google search comes up with the suggestion to replace drum bearings when hearing noises in the rear.  Is there a drum bearing part for this model?",

You will need to order the Multi Rib Belt - 92-1/4\", Part Number: PS346995 and the Rear Drum Support Roller Kit, Part Number: PS2162268. Your model dose not have the drum that requires a bearing.Your drum rides on the lip at the back of the appliance, on the lip there is a felt seal that prevents the noise you are hearing.

Then the idler arm bolts back to the motor mount, and the spring is replaced.Reinstalling is easy - place the drum, have someone support it while you install the drum brace, then replace the front panel, then the control panel.

        "storyTitle": "Fixing a squeaky dryer",
        "repairInstruction": "There are several parts that will cause the dryer to squeak, drum roller, idler pully and the drum slides. To start, remove the door and the two opposite screws. Pull the front cover down and remove, no screws to remove, this is a snaped on piece. Next, remove the two screws holding the dryer top bracket and lift the top. Take drum su pport by removing the screws and then remove the belt from the motor and remove the drum. The hardest part was removing the C clips from the roller axle even with the snap ring pliers. Replace the drum rollers and reverse the process to re-assemble. Of course, the rollers weren't the problem even though they were worn out from 20 years of service. I ended up replacing the idler pully and and the idler pully support arm. If I had all of the parts prior to starting, the total time would have been about an hour. I did watch several YouTube videos before attempting the repair. That helped me understand the \"how\" and made it easy once I started the repair. Read less"

Fantastic customer service. PartSelect also has excellent installation videos you can watch to assist. Took me a little over an hour to open up the dryer, replace the drum rollers, drum belt, idler roller and both front and rear felt seals.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Dale. We can address both your problems! The thumping sound is most commonly caused by a drum roller that is failing 12001541. A failing drum roller teamed with a worn seal WP33001807Â is most likely the reason your clothes are getting marked. If the seal is worn it will cause the clothes to catch on the gap where the seal is located, this could snag them and create black marks. Good luck with this repair!"

I donât want to buy 2 of these without knowing for sure. What else would you recommend checking at the same time? My wife wants the noise gone.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Paul, thanks for getting in touch. You did find the right roller for your model, it is 12001541 and you will need two of them for this repair. We also recommend checking your felt seals to make sure they are sturdy and in place, and that your idler pulley is in a good working condition. These are all the most common reasons a dryer would be squeaky during cycle."

The drum support rollers, PartSelect Number PS1570070. The drum glides, PartSelect Number PS1804752. The Drum Felt Seal, Dryer Drum Felt Seal or the Idler Pulley, PartSelect Number PS11743032. All these parts have videos on our site on how to install them. It will show how to take the appliance apart to get to them as well. Only way to know for sure is to take a look at the parts to see what one needs to be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Laura, Thank you for the question.Unfortunately the noise can be caused by a few things.You may need to take the appliance apart to confirm what part is needed. First you can check the Dryer Drum Seal with Adhesive on the front of the drum., It can wear down and rub and cause the squeaking.This seal is also located on the back of the drum. You can also check the Drum Support Rollers and the shaft that holds the rollers.The drive belt can also cause the squeaking once it starts to wear or if the Idler Pulley with Bracket needs to be replaced.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Aana,\nThank you for your question.  If you are hearing a rattling noise in the dryer it could be the rollers, but it could also be a loose belt causing the noise as well.  You will need to inspect the parts to see which ones are causing the issue.  If the dryer is setting off too soon, it may be the thermostats in the dryer.  You will need to test the parts with a multimeter to see if they are working correctly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

You can also check the rollers to see if they were damaged while you are down there. You can check the felt seals on the front and back of the appliance for wear. The only way to know what the cause of the vibrating is to open up the cabinet to check the parts. Hope this helps!"

If you have not opened your dryer up and d one this, 10/10 recommend, because in doing so i found that the motor was the real culprit. Once i opened it up more, especially cleaning around the blower fan and motor, i was half a day in. Put it all back together and got it running for two more loads before the motor quit. Replaced that and since the hard work was done, had it back in in half an hour and running great. Probably will need to redo the felt seal one day, but for now, i am calling it a win.

If you have already replaced your support rollers and idler pulley and are still having no luck, we recommend checking your blower wheel and the tumbler.

I hope this helps!"

Unfortunately the packet did not contain any instructions and I have not received an answer to the questions I submitted on january 29, 2019 at the time I ordered the parts. Before I begin to install the new rollers I would like you to tell me what product would be best to use to thoroughly clean the gummy substance off of the drum support roller shafts.

        "repairInstruction": "I took off the front of the dryer with the screws at the bottom. I removed what wires would easily come off and took a picture to remember where they go. Then I took of the front panel and had to take off the cover for the blower wheel. Some screws were difficult to reach because they were in a very tight space. I used a combination of ne edle nose pliers and a hex screw bit to loose hared to reach hex screws. For the felt seal on the front panel, I used a flathead screwdriver to remove the old seal and replace the new seal. The most tricky thing was making sure the seal was laying right along the drum when putting the front panel back on. Once back together, the skidding sound disappeared. Replacing the blower wheel is pretty easy once I got past the difficult screws holding the cover down. I used snap ring pliers to remove the snap ring then put the new blower wheel on and put it all back together. I found that the tip diameter of the snap ring pliers needed to be less than 0.05'' to fit into the snap ring holes of both the snap rings for the roller wheels and the blower wheel. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Dryer would struggle to start, but never run.",
        "repairInstruction": "When this dryer was given to me, I was told the door switch was going bad. It was originally purchased in 1996 as a REAL MAYTAG, so fixing it was no brainer, but the switch did not fix the problem. I pulled the small panel off the back to expose the motor and struggled to spin it by hand, so I assumed the motor was seizing up. r />I entered the model number into this website and found a motor that would work and also decided to go with a belt and a fan. There was an installation video provided when I added the motor to my cart. The dryer was older than mine, but obviously identical on the interior. The only difference was that older dryer didn't have a little deflector shield that I have and I still can't remember where that goes. My dryer appears to be working just fine without it though. Like the video stated:Remove two screws at the bottom of the front panel to remove the panel while disconnecting the door switch wires. Since I had an old switch, I took the three wires and plugged them into that so I would remember where each one went . I believe after that was the fan housing with a few bolts, then the drum. I reached through the small back panel to loosen the belt by moving the tensioner back, then removing the drum. The fan was secured by a snap ring and a spring loaded hose clamp that required a small set of pliers. There were two bolts that held the motor in; once removed, the motor slid out with the bracket. The tough part was using the screwdriver to get the clamps off that hold the motor to the bracket, but the video helped with that. The new motor did not come with instructions on how to wire it, so I had to go to this site and find somebody who had asked the question. The video did not do all that great a job in showing me where the wires go and since the motor was different than my REAL MAYTAG motor, I had no idea where the wires went, but I found someone who asked the question and he got the answer, so I was able to figure it out. It had been over a month since I had taken the dryer apart so I went back to that video which, except for the wiring and that tiny little deflector plate, provided excellent detail of how to install everything. I had trouble deciding where I wanted the wires to make sure the drum didn't rub on them, so after it was all back together, I watched the drum rotate with the dryer running from that little panel in the back. One thing that saved me was every time I took something off, I kept the bolts with that item. It only became a problem when my friend came over and saw the dryer in pieces. He just had to give me his own lecture about fixing dryers and when he talks he has touch everything, so all my bolts are going flying! I was like, \"What are you doing? Are you gonna put this back together for me after you lose all my bolts?\" Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "Every two to three years, the blower wheel gets chewed out in the center where it attaches to the motor shaft. I have learned the sound of it starting to rattle so I know to order a new blower before the air stops moving altogether. Replacing it is very easy if you have tiny sockets or nut drivers and a pair of snap ring pliers. r />When working on this dryer, be aware that the heater wires are always \"hot\", even when the dryer is not running. You are only likely to touch one at a time so the worst you will feel is 120 volts. The shock probably won't hurt you but you may cut yourself jerking your arm out of the dryer. Best to unplug the dryer or open the circuit breaker before sticking your arm in there! Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "The repair video is terrific and many others here have thoroughly described the steps involved to replace the drive motor.The biggest hurdle for me was that the motor came with a new switch that required a different wiring configuration. No wiring diagram was included. Several others had posted questions about wiring in the Q&A and unfortunately PartSelect kept copy/pasting the same confusing and incomplete answer over and over:\"The Yellow goes to T6, Red to T5 Black to T2, blue to T1 and the white you will remove the blue jumper lead between the switch terminal 4 and 1/4\" protector tab, connect the grey harness lead to the 1/4\" protector tab.\"Reading that doesn't tell me what to do with the white wire, doesn't address that my blue and white wires were crimped into the same connector from the factory, doesn't address that I had 2 black wires crimped into the same connector from the factory, and doesn't address a factory ground wire that connected the frame of the OEM motor to the bracket that the motor sits in.With all the other excellent info supplied by PartSelect, this was surprising and frustrating. The sales dept ignored an emailed question from me, and the Q&A section didn't allow me to post a question.Searching the internet, I found a wiring diagram on aceappliancesd dot com that addressed my dryer's OEM wiring configuration. Here's what I ended up with:TI - Blue and white, crimped together into a single connectorT2 - Black & black, crimped together into a single connector (the wiring diagram I found said this should be black & brown, but they both look black to me)T5 - RedT6 - Yellow1/4\" Thermal protector tab - Grey (from the harness)The new motor switch had a grounding tab with nothing connected to it. I removed the screw holding that tab into the switch and connected the (also grey) OEM short ground wire from the motor frame to the mounting bracket.I had to cut 2 of the pieces of tape holding the OEM wiring harness together in order to get enough slack for all the connections to reach. If you do this too, make sure all the wires are still clear of the moving parts and the hot bits. You may need to retape the wires together at a different location to keep things tidy.I also laid the belt over the drum and put 2 pieces of tape over it to hold it in place while I got the drum positioned, then I reached through the back access panel to loop the belt around the motor pulley and idler. Once that's done, just reach over the top of the drum and peel the tape off. I found that much easier than trying to loop the belt by reaching through and past the drum. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi William,\nThank you for your question.  The blower wheel is mostly responsible for blowing the heat into the dryer cavity.  If the dryer is not tumbling, then there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the tumbler and motor belt, the drum support rollers, the idler pulley wheel and arm, the idler shaft retaining ring, the front glides, the roller shafts and the drive motor.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Suzette, thanks for your query. The most obvious reason behind blocked airflow through lint filter and exhaust is a clogged exhaust part and damaged lint filter but as you have checked and cleaned it then we are all good there. However, these problems may also happen because of damaged or jammed blower wheels, covers of a dryer vent that are stuck, and also clogs within the dryer unit. Look for some venting hose clogs and hidden inner dryer clogs. If no vent hose and inner clogs are found then the blower wheel is most probably faulty or damaged. In this case the blower wheel compatible with model number MEDB400VQ0 has part number PS11746331. If you have any other follow-up queries please feel free to reach out again."

All looked good except the wheel on the Idler lever which was tight. I vacuumed up the years of lint and reassembled the dryer and waited for the parts to arrive. I ordered the idler lever and also the 2 drum support wheels, belt and 2 drum guides since I thought that is was a good idea to go ahead and replace these parts once I had the dryer disassembled again. Good choice on the belt as once I removed the old belt there was a crack on the underside of the belt. I bought snap ring pliers at home depot but the tips were too big to fit the holes on the snap rings on the drum rollers. I bought another snap ring plier set from an automotive store that came wth 5 snap ring attachments - but again all were too large to fit the snap rings on the drum support rollers. I used a nail and small screwdriver to expand and pull off the snap rings but this approach was frustrating and time consuming. Not sure where to get snap ring pliers that are small enough to fit the holes on the snap rings - so hope that you have better luck locating a set thats small enough! I was able to return the pliers that I purchased - so all good. I was surprised at how easy the dryer came apart and how easy it was easy to work on. When disassembling the dryer - we took pictures of the wire connections before we disconnected them, however at one point we tilted the dryer back to clean behind it and the top slipped a little away from the side panel of the dryer and one of the wires that was connect to the wire block that is up by where the power cord connects cam loose - and it took some time to find and figure out a wiring diagram for this connection. Suggest that you take a pictire of this wire connection block once you lift the lid - just in case a slip occurs and a wire may disconnect. When replacing the idler lever - have a little grease available when you install the new idler lever (between the arm and the bolt area as it constantly moves and the old brease has probably worn away) . After making these repairs I dont think I will ever buy a new dryer as any part , including the heater and motor would be easy to replace and cheaper than a new dryer. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "Replaced the two drum rollers and the tensioning arm roller. NOTES: 1. There are two drum rollers, the diagram seems to show only one. Recommend replacing both drum rollers and the support bracket shaft assemblies since the shafts might be scored. 2. The tensioning arm roller was actually much worse and frozen, so once you are in it is best to replace ALL three rollers. 3. I also replaced the belt since it was worse for wear from the frozen rollers. 4. The PartSelect video for the procedure is for the Whirlpool branded version of this dryer. The internal parts and construction are identical, however, the initial steps for opening up the dryer are different. On the Amana the top also tilts up, but is held down by two bolts, and not just the spring clips. Steps are: a) Remove bottom kick plate which is held in by two bolts on the lower front edge. b) remove the retention bolts that are now exposed on the front panel and remove the front panel by pulling it down from the top spring clips. c) Unbolt and remove the front drum retention panel. d) The two bolts that hold down the top can now be removed and the top panel tilted up so the drum can be lifted out after the belt is loosened. The whole process is very quick and easy. Only tricky part is fumbling around behind the motor to move the tensioning roller and arm to remove and re-install the belt. Also, I had cheap spring clip pliers so I was fumbling with the spring clips that hold the rollers on their shafts. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Excessive Drum Noise While Drying Clothes",
        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Dyer made a squealing/screeching noise",
        "repairInstruction": "I have read other postings which describe most of the procedure very well, so I'm just going to add things that should be considered, which I have not read about here. Removing the drum proved difficult due to the lack of room on the two sides.The vent blower motor bracket is at the front bottom of the dryer, and when the two screws on either the left or right side are removed, the dryer sides spread more easily and allow the drum to be removed or re-installed more easily. Next, the rear drum bearing I bought has a rubber o-ring which holds it in place. There is a good chance this o-ring will be hard and brittle after years of service, and will crumble when removed, in order to replace the bearing. I had to run to the local hardware store to get a new o-ring, and could only find one that did was not rated for high heat usage. I presumed once the drum is re-installed that the bearing can't dislodge even with a missing o-ring. I think it just holds the bearing in place while removing and re-installing the drum, but I cannot be certain about this.So if you plan to replace the rear drum bearing, make sure to also order the o-ring that holds it in place. It is doubtful you can re-use the old one depending on the age of your dryer.Replacing the old white belt tensioning pulley requires the removal and re-installation of a \"nut\" that has no threads. It is forced on and off and not simple to re-install. The removal was easy simply by using a wrench to \"unscrew\" it counterclockwise. But re-installing it is another matter. It requires force to get it back onto the shaft. I saw a tip to use a 7/16\" socket placed over the nut and hit with a hammer while bracing the bracket from the other side. I did this by used a smaller tool, linesman's pliers, which provided the force needed. Install it about 1/4\" past the end of the bracket shaft. Careful, that nut has sharp edges and I ended up bleeding from that process. Three hands would help: one to brace the bracket, one to hold the nut and socket in place, and one to hammer. So good luck with that. Probably there is a smarter way to do this.If you replace the old white plastic belt tensioning pulley with a new yellow one, it is not simple to understand how to re-install the belt properly. The videos do not do the trick adequately. I did find one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an \"aha moment\". Since you cannot see the belt, the pulleys, the motor, or anything else during installation, it is not a simple thing to do. Here are my tips: Before re-installing the drum, move the belt tensioning pulley bracket to the right (when facing the dryer front) and you will see a little spot where the bracket will stay to the right when engaged in this spot. Engage the bracket and then proceed to re-install the drum. That way, when you reach under the drum to set the belt properly on the pulleys, you won't have to engage the tensioning bracket without being able to see. Once the belt is in place, carefully remove the bracket from the right holding spot and allow it to move back to the left operating position. I used two hands and don't think I could have done it with one. When the belts are new, they can be naturally twisted and you have to be careful to install the belt with no twist. I had to do it twice to get it right. If someone can take up the top belt slack for you, it's easy to feel the belt underneath the drum and get any twists out.Next, i had a hard time inserting the drum back into the dryer and finding the hole where the bearing inserts. The problem is, if you are not careful, it's easy to move, bend, or break the heater wires which surround the hole you need to locate blindly and slip the drum bearing into. I did bend those wires, but luckily not break them. In hindsight, applying some masking tape to the rear inside panel of the dryer right at the top, left and right of the drum BEFORE removing the drum would have made it much easier estimating the proper drum height while maneuvering the bearing into the rear hole. Then remove the masking tape when done. I ordered a new top plastic front bearing that supports the drum in the front. Good thing I did because mine was split about 5\" where one set of the green and white sliders install. I had one white \"plastic\" insert visible. The other one plus the two green bearings were totally missing. No wonder it was squealing.Finally, the hardest part for me was re-installing the top of the dryer! Take a good look before removing it so you can see exactly how the top fits to the dryer and how the parts need to be lined up first. Thanks to PartSelect.com! Every part was correct and the installation videos gave me so much help. Also, parts arrived in two days, which surprised me. I will be ordering all parts here. Read less"

Make sure it is not rubbing or needs to be replaced.While you are checking the belt you can check the Idler Pulley the belt sits on. Make sure the wheel is in good condition and not damaged. You will also need to check the Front Drum Bearing and the Slides. The slides will wear down over time and if not replaced the tabs on the bearing will also wear off and the bearing will need to be replaced with the slides. There is also a Felt Seal that attaches to the bottom half of the drum on the front. This prevent the drum from rubbing and causing the noise as well. If you are replacing the Front Drum Bearing and Slides it is a good idea to replace the Felt at the same time. If all of these parts check out then the problem would be the Rear Drum Bearing Kit. Hope this helps!"

Thanks, carroll",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Carroll,\nThank you for your question.  There are some other parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  There is a felt strip in the back of the drum that runs along the bottom of the tub that may have come off.  If it came off and moved towards the front of the drum, it can rub against the metal at the front of the dryer and cause this noise.  Another part that may cause the noise you are hearing is the motor.  If a load of clothes in the dryer is too heavy it can cause strain on the motor and also cause the noise you are hearing.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "storyTitle": "dryer after 1-3 minutes would start to buzz and vibrate - not loud nor shaking/vibrating alot but it was there",
        "repairInstruction": "The repair actually was quite easy but diagnosing the problem was another story. I found out that the dryer would not buzz and vibrate , if I just ran the fluff cycle but no heat. As soon as heat applied, the slight buzzing and slight vibrating would occur after a few minutes. I knew it wasn't the drum bearing, the drum rollers, the ru bbing collar on front of drum, idle arm, belt, etc - I had replaced all of them less than a year ago. Anything I found on the internet dealing with the motor was always geared around not running or slow starting or shutting down, loud buzzing, needing a push start to start, etc but that was not the case. So I figured it was the blower housing and ordered that part. However, once I had the machine apart the blower housing seemed to be just fine - nothing obvious, everything tight. The one issue I had was removing the plastic nut with the metal insert on the blower unit that attaches it to the motor shaft which just wouldn't bulge. So I said to myself, the h*ll with it, lets get a new motor, too and remove both parts together which btw, was very easy. So that is exactly what I did. Now with new motor in hand and new blower housing in hand, I easily removed the old motor still attached to the old blower housing together and replaced both which was very easy. Hooked everything back up and no more soft buzzing or slight vibration. Now back to the problem or my guess at this point. I noticed that the rubber mounting bushing in the back of the motor which is used to attached it to the dryer bracket was funking looking - kinda soft and a bit perished. So I am surmising that once heat was introduced, it was enough to soften that bushing enough to cause the slight buzzing and slight vibration but without the heat to soften the bushing a bit, it was quiet and steady. Just a guess but for anyone that has this issue with just heat but no issue with fluff (no heat) check out the condition of that rubber mounting bushing on the rear of the motor. No where on the internet was there any info concerning the symptoms I had and I was flying by the seat of my pants. So am taking the time to get this on record in case someone else has these symptoms and finds it. Read less"

The blower wheel moves freely both clockwise or counter clockwise problem seems to be it also moves forward off the shaft then rubs on the front of the assembly. Does whole thing need replaced or is there something that holds it in place?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello, thank you for your inquiry!  More than likely, you will need to replace the blower housing with blower wheel, as we are not showing there are any separate parts listed for sale that are meant to secure the blower wheel in place.  It would come as part of this assembly.  Hope this helps!"

I would suggest removing the blower housing to see if the wheel is moving freely and that there isn't anything stuck inside the blower housing.

        "repairInstruction": "This dryer is 30 plus years old. I am a 71 year old female that has never taken on this type of repair. First I very carefully ordered all parts possibly associated with this problem. Watched all videos available for this model. Could not find one at Parts Select that addressed this particular dryer. Model number was correct. Finally found YouTube video that addressed an \"Old Kenmore Wood Top\". It showed the correct way to remove the Heating Element unit. Also Parts Select never mentions that fuses and sensors are not \"polarized\". Very important info for a novice. But Google helped me with that. Heating Element is \"polarized\", very important not to cross wires. I did order a couple Heating Element Connection Wire Kits that were not needed for this repair. Got all parts replaced, put dryer back together, crossed my fingers and turned it on, so far it has been working really well. I chose to replace all the parts I did because of the dryers age, plus I am not familiar with multimeters. Didn't want to risk one old part messing up a new part. Thank you Parts Select.It is not a 2 hr. repair, but I worked slowly, didn't want to make any mistakes. It would be good if everyone is aware of some of the above information and the YouTube video done by an individual on this particular dryer. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Justin, thanks for getting in touch. This sounds like it is the thermal fuse WP3392519, but before replacing it you should inspect and test it for visible damage or indication of faultiness. If the thermal fuse is open and not working, your next check should be the exhaust ducting, since it is the most common reason for a thermal fuse to malfunction. Please let us know if you have further questions."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Sandi, \n\nThat's a great question, you can use an multi meter and test the continuity of the fuse.If no current is detected, it means there's no continuity and the fuse is defective. \n\nGood luck with this repair."

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer will start drying the clothes, but then after a few minutes, the heating stops.  All the controls work - but the dryer seems to be only blowing room temperature air.  I have cleaned the duct inside the dryer, and through the duct from the dryer to outside. I read that if the fuse was blown that the dryer would not start.  Except for lack of heat throughout the cycle, the dryer thinks it is working just fine.  What is my next step?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Vickie, Thank you for the question. Normally with the Thermal Fuse the dryer would still run as normally but there will be no heat. So you would still have the appliance start and tumble but blow cold or room temperature air. If the fuse blows it just stops electricity going to the element its self not the appliance. Hope this helps!"

      {
        "customerQuestion": "My dryer is not heating but still runs. Checked the thermal fuse and its not that.What else could it be?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Margaret, Thank you for the question. If the Thermal Fuse has tested to be good, I suggest checking the High Limit Thermostat,PartSelect Number PS11741456.This hi-limit thermostat acts as as safety mechanism that keeps the dryer from overheating. Once the dryer temperature reaches a certain point, this piece will shut down power to the heating element. When defective it will not send power to the element in order for it to heat up to dry the clothes. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Alison, although there are a few causes to this issue, the most common one is the exhaust ducting. If there is too much heat trapped inside the ducting it will cause the thermal fuse to open. What you need to find is any air flow problems. Is there breakage or clogging in your duct? Is it too long? The next thing to check would be if the ducting has condensation or water in it, or if there are dryer sheets in the blower wheel. Lastly you can check the drum seal to see if it is malfunctioning. Best of luck!"

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer works just does heat up thinking thermal fuse  thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dave,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If your dryer is not heating the most common parts to fix the issue are the heating element, the thermal fuse, the thermal cut-off kit, the high limit thermostat, the heating element connection wire kit and the internal bias thermostat to name a few.  To verify which part is causing the issue, you will need a multimeter. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Where is the thermal fuse located",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Pete,\n\nThat's a great question. The thermal fuse is located on the blower fan housing. To get to that part you will need a few tools: a hex socket, a putty knife, a flat head screwdriver, and also a phillips screwdriver. Please make sure to disconnect power to your appliance before ever attempting any repair. First you will want to remove the top panel screws. Place your top panel safely out of the way. Then take a look at your control panel. Press in the tabs on either side to pop it out of place. Disconnect the wire harness and then remove the screws to be able to move your circuit board bracket out of the way. Then remove the screws on the control bracket up front. Now you will want to remove the screws from the lower panel at the bottom of your machine. You can just lift that part right out. After that you will want to disconnect the moisture sensor and door switch wire harnesses. One set of wires should be yellow while the other set are brown, white, and blue. Then you will want to remove the screws at the bottom and top of your front panel. There are two mounting screws on the inside of your door panel. There are on either side of the filter. Remove those as well to be able to pull off the front panel. You will then remove the lower bulkhead screws and only loose the top screws. Don't take those ones off fully. Also remove the screw holding the blower housing in place as well. Then lift the bulkhead off the top screws and set it aside. After that you will remove the dryer belt from the motor pulley and pulley. I would suggest taking a picture of how the belt is installed on your appliance. So that you can reinstall it the same way. Use the belt to help you lift out the drum. Now you will have access to the thermal fuse inside of your machine. You can remove that part by unplugging it and removing the screw. To get your drum back into place, align its rim with the two rear rollers. Then follows these steps backwards and you will be able to put your machine b"

It is a safety mechanism that stops the flow of electricity to the heating element when a dryer overheats. When this fuse is faulty, your dryer will not start or it will not heat properly and shuts off to soon. This is a one-time fuse, meaning it cannot be re-set, It must be replaced.\n\nHope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Larry,\n\nThanks for your question. You will want a multimeter to test a few different internal parts. Replace any that do not show electrical continuity. Also be sure to clean out the venting if that is clogged. Test the internal-bias thermostat, the thermal fuse, the high-limit thermostat, and the heating element. Visually inspect the belt as well for any signs of wear and tear.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "customerQuestion": "I have an Admiral electric dryer, aed4475tq1.  Lately on autodry, it mostly dries the cloths but then i have to use the 20 30 time dry to finish drying the cloths.  Basically, the dryer is shutting off just a little too early on autodry.  I don't think this dryer has a moisture sensor to clean.  Ventilation is good and there is no build up of lint internally or on the filter.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Brian, thank you for your question. The issue is most likely with a thermostat. There are a few thermostats in the unit. With a multimeter, these parts can be tested very easily. The parts you will want to check are Thermostat, Internal-Bias Part Number: WP3387134, Thermal Cut-Off Kit Part Number: 279816 and Thermostat, High Limit 221 F ( Part Number: WP3977767. Set your multimeter to the R X 1 setting. Take each of your meter's probes and touch one to each terminal. You are testing for continuity, and you should receive a reading of either zero or infinity. At room temperature, testing the thermostat should produce a reading of zero. But if a thermostat is tested when it is heated to its limit, a reading of infinity should be produced. We strongly recommend that you test your thermostat at room temperature. If the test you conduct with your thermostat does not produce these results, then you should replace the component. I hope this helps. Thank you and have a great day!"

First I very carefully ordered all parts possibly associated with this problem. Watched all videos available for this model. Could not find one at Parts Select that addressed this particular dryer. Model number was correct. Finally found YouTube video that addressed an \"Old Kenmore Wood Top\". It showed the correct way to remove the Heating Element unit. Also Parts Select never mentions that fuses and sensors are not \"polarized\". Very important info for a novice. But Google helped me with that. Heating Element is \"polarized\", very important not to cross wires. I did order a couple Heating Element Connection Wire Kits that were not needed for this repair. Got all parts replaced, put dryer back together, crossed my fingers and turned it on, so far it has been working really well. I chose to replace all the parts I did because of the dryers age, plus I am not familiar with multimeters. Didn't want to risk one old part messing up a new part. Thank you Parts Select.It is not a 2 hr. repair, but I worked slowly, didn't want to make any mistakes.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Miriam, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Thermistor,PartSelect Number: PS3529026. When testing you will test for resistance. At 70 degrees the resistance should be 9.3K ohms, 90 degrees would be 7.7K ohms. at 100 degrees it should be 6.2K ohms, 120 degrees 4.3K ohms. If the thermistor reads outside of range then it needs replaced. Hope this helps!"

After installation of the parts, still no heat and heating element was registering only 120v. We checked everything again and found that the dryer plug was not all the way in the socket. Probably came loose with the move to the petestal.....plugged it in securely and it works great now. Should have checked that first, but because it was running we just didn't think of checking it. Good lesson learned and so glad we found this website. We will definately be using this site again and telling everyone we know about how great you guys are!

Could this be the heating element or is there another part that could be faulty? This is the first time my dryer has not worked since 2005.  Thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Anthony, thank you for your question. The first thing you will want to do is vacuum the inside of the unit around the element, the tumbler, the motor and the ducting. If there are not obstructions, and the unit continues to not heat. You will want to check the thermostats. There are a couple of them on the unit; Thermal Fuse Part Number: WP3392519, High Limit Thermostat and Thermal Fuse Kit Part Number: 279973, Thermostat, Internal-Bias Part Number: WP8577274, and the \t\nHigh Limit Thermostat - L295-50F Part Number: WP3391914. These can all be tested with a multimeter. Use a multimeter to test the thermostat's resistance by setting it to the RX 1 setting.\nPlace each of the meter's probes onto the wire terminals. You should receive a reading of 0. Resistance that is low, or near 0, means that the electrical flow is good and the part does not need to be replaced. If the thermostats test as being in good condition and working properly, the element would be the issue. I hope this helps!"

Both showed connectivity except when I heated the thermostat in an electric skillet.  If 'clicked' off at 280 degrees Celsius.  I have not checked the other part included in 279973 (another thermal fuse?) other than to verify that it has zero ohms of resistance.

If the dryer is not starting there are some other parts you should also check as well to see if they are causing the issue.  I would also check the door switch, the start switch, the motor, the electronic control board and the terminal block.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

When the part arrived, I replaced the old unit with the new, plugged the two wires back on, and I was done. Just for additional information, when I touched the heating coil during the repair, it broke. After 16 years, the heating coils get brittle, so I also replaced the heating coil and it's thermostat just above it (about the size of 6 quarters glued together).

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Gerry,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The thermostats that are listed under your model number are designed to work with your appliance.  There is a high limit kit listed under your model number, part number PS2162282.  The high limit kit comes with three separate thermal fuses for dryers. One electric thermal fuse with a limit of 258, one gas high limit at 240, and one gas and electric high limit thermostat with a limit at 300. The thermal fuse kit shuts off the motor in the dryer when it begins to overheat. If the dryer will not heat, is overheated, shuts off too soon, or takes too long to dry then the thermal fuse might have exploded and need to be replaced. For replacement instructions refer to the diagram by manufacturer. For safety, unplug the dryer before installing the part.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Nathan,\nThank you for contacting us.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the high limit thermostats, the belt, the door catch, the timer resistor assembly, the door switch, the timer assembly and the door switch.  I hope this helps.

        "customerQuestion": "I suspect the thermal switch is bad. When i was looking at it, i noticed i could push in the back side of the switch. Is that normal ?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Boyd,\nThank you for your question.  To verify if the switch is bad, you will need to test it with a multimeter.  Disconnect the power source to your dryer before you conduct this or any other test. Either unplug the unit from the wall outlet, remove the appropriate fuse from the fuse box, or flip the appropriate breaker in the circuit breaker panel.\nYour dryer uses multiple thermostats to regulate its internal temperature. The cycle selected determines which thermostat is used. A cycling thermostat can be found somewhere in the path of air that is leaving the drum. It could be found on the blower wheel housing or inside the venting/exhaust system. Dryer thermostats are usually oval shaped and about an inch and a half in length. Also, there should be two wires leading to each thermostat. Label these wires before you remove them so that you are able to correctly reconnect them later.\n\nThe wires leading to the thermostat are connected using metal slip on connectors. Remove the wires by pulling on the connectors, and not the wires themselves. It may be a good idea to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you.\n\nSet your multimeter to the R X 1 setting. Take each of your meter's probes and touch one to each terminal. You are testing for continuity, and you should receive a reading of either zero or infinity. At room temperature, testing the thermostat should produce a reading of zero. But if a thermostat is tested when it is heated to its limit, a reading of infinity should be produced. We strongly recommend that you test your thermostat at room temperature.  If the test you conduct with your thermostat does not produce these results, then you should replace the component.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "I have a german dryer \"asko\" and no parts exist for this model.  I have talked to the asko parts distributor for north america, no parts.  Can i replace the thermostat(125f-31f) and thermal fuse (140f-35f) with american parts.  How much can i vary from these temperatures and differentials.  As i understand it the thermostat can vary from 125-94, 31 being the differential and the same goes for the fuse.  Where can i find them where the specs are shown.  Most of the sites on show the thermastat specs but not the fuse.  Can anyone help.  If you want to reply my email is jsanchez1dad@yahoo.Com  thanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jaime, Thank you for contacting us. I am sorry however I am not able to find any concrete information to advise whether or not you are able to interchange the parts, as often different countries have different safety standards. I suggest reaching out to a local technician or Asko directly. Good luck with your repair. Have a wonderful day!"

I especially appreciate Steve's videos demonstrating step-by-step procedures for disassembly, part installation, and reassembly. Very thorough. I timed each presentation---five minut es for one, less than ten for the other. I watched the videos several times and took notes, so I would have the procedures in front of me while working on the unit at the other end of the house, I'm 77, forgetful. When I disassembled my unit, I noticed several rusted areas, so decided not to complete the project until I could get to the store for paint. As a primary care-giver for a severely dementiated 79-year Old Lady, I have to arrange for a relief to go shopping. That's why the machine is still in pieces. Got the paint, though, so back to work---eventually. When I disassembled the dryer, tucked away in the bottom was a very informative TECH SHEET, the discovery of which ticked me off that it wasn't provided with the owner's manual.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Paul. thank you for your question. When you are experiencing an issue like this there are a few parts that you will have to test to determine what is causing your issue. For all of these parts you can test them with a multi meter. First you will have to test your thermostats and thermal fuses to make sure they are all functioning correctly. After that you will want to test parts in this order, your m series coils, igniter itself, or your radiant flame sensor. You may also want to check your regulator just to make sure that part is functioning properly as well.  Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If I wait a while and press start it will spin but if I stop and or open the dryer door it will hum and not spin making me repeat this cycle. My guess is the motor can't handle the load and is going bad or something is causing too much of a load for the motor.",

If there is a power surge, that will blow your fuse. It does indeed seem like because of the way that you installed the part, that is why it blew so quickly. You could check all of your thermostats to see if they are malfunctioning at all. However it just seems like you would need to install the part properly and it should be alright. Good luck with your repair Hal."

I would suggest testing both the high limit thermostat and your thermal cut off on your heating element to make sure that they are working correctly. It sounds like your high limit thermostat might be not working correctly. Testing the thermal cut off as well is just to cover all of your bases. You can test those parts with a multi meter. When you test them, if they are both showing zero, then those parts are fine and you may need to then test your heating element. The ohms should also be showing zero for that part as well.

        "customerQuestion": "My gas dryer won't turn 9n, says door open, and has code E66. Do I replace the Thermo Limiter, or the Thermostat fuse?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Bob, Thank you for your inquiry. This code usually indicates that the thermal limiter has tripped and needs to be replaced. You can test the thermal fuses with a multimeter to see which one is causing the issue, and also check for any obstructions to the vent that could be causing the dryer to overheat. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. With your multi-meter set to Rx1, touch the probes to each terminal, you are testing for continuity and should have a reading of zero or infinity. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

I checked the low limit fuse with an ohm meter and it had continuity. When I checked the High limit fuse it did not, there was infinite resistance meaning it was open and not providing current to the heater ele ments. Out of concern why the high limit blew, I decided to replace the thermostat as well. As I dissembled the dryer there was an over abundance of lint from years of use. I also notice the drum belt had some chunks missing and decided to replace it since I was removing it anyway. Ordered the parts from Part Select and they arrived in a timely manner as promised. Replaced the defective parts, vacuumed out all the lint and junk that was coating the drive motor and other items. Resembled the dryer and it worked good as new. total cost of $60 in parts, and couple of hours and back in business! Read less"

If your dryer gets extra hot at the end of the drying cycle and your fuse and sensors have continuity, the issue you are facing is a malfunctioning limit thermostat, part number PS11748479. This thermostat acts as a safety mechanism that keeps the dryer from overheating. With this thermostat, a dryer's heating element will cut out if the internal temperature reaches 225 degrees Fahrenheit. The heating element will kick back in when the temperature drops to 185 degrees Fahrenheit - a differential of 40 degrees. We hope this information is helpful!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Garcia, your symptoms are a common sign of a clogged venting system. We recommend checking the venting system, and cleaning it out. When doing this make sure to clean the pipe and the dryer. Please let us know if you have any further questions."

With that said theres a glow emitting from the back of the dryer and its bright red when the dryer is running. Is this suppose to happen, is this a fire hazard, is the element being over worked?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Simon, if the housing is installed right, the element is meant to glow red hot and should not be hazardous. This is normal. Just make sure that the element is cycling on and off when the dryer is running, it is not meant to stay red hot the whole time. I hope this helps."

        "customerQuestion": "Hi, i am having trouble with my dryer drying the cloths.  It gets hot if i set it for 60 min.  But then cools down after a while and never gets hot again.  The cloths don't get dry and i have to set it again for 60 min. Then it gets hot and finishes drying.  I have replaced the three thermostats, cleaned all lint out.  Can't figure it out.  Could it be the temperature setting?  The heating coil looks ok , no breaks in the coils.  Pleas help with any suggestions.  Thanks.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Steve,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. There are a few parts that could cause that problem. The thermostats being some of them. Have you also checked or replaced your thermal fuse? You may also want to test your heating element electrical connection to make sure that is still good. It could also be your temperature switch that is giving you the issue as well. I hope that gives your some more avenues to check out. Good luck with your repair."

      {
        "customerQuestion": "Is it possible for this element to go partially out ? And if so what should i do ? Replace the element anyway",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Beverly,\n\nThank you for your question. It can partially go out. I would suggest replacing it if it has. You can test this part with a multi meter to double check. If that part is working, I would suggest then testing your high limit thermostat and your thermal limit as well. Those two parts that are directly on the housing for your heating element. It could just be that one or both of those parts have gone out. You can also test those two thermostats with your multi meter. They should both read 0 ohms when you test them. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If the timer is working on automatic dry and not on timed dry, it sounds like the timed dry option is the option that is frequently used when drying and it is worn out. You will need to replace the timer.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Test the heating element for continuity with a multimeter, along with the thermal fuse, thermal cut-off kit, internal-bias thermostat, and high-limit thermostat. If all of these parts are testing properly for continuity, consider replacing the timer.\n\nI hope this helps."

I would suggest testing the thermostats part number PS991443 and  PS11746386, and PS11746740. It may have been a one off occurrence but testing the thermostat will tell you if one or more has failed. You should also clean the unit well, especially around the blower housing and heating element as a build up of lint can cause the unit to overheat. I hope this helps!"

My husband is good at repairing things so we decided to order the part and do the repairs rather than hire a service technician. Before looking at the dryer we thought the back could be unscrewed and taken off to give access to the element but it did not. He had to take the dr yer drum out to access the element. It was easy enough for him to do though and since we had everything opened up I was able to use the shop vac to get all lint cleaned out. I'm glad he did have to take the drum out after I realized the gasket on the exhaust pipe wasn't fitted on properly. There was some lint where there should not have been. Now that everything is clean and we have the new heating element installed we are good to go! The whole process of taking apart, installation and putting back together took about an hour and 15 minutes so not bad and we only had to pay for the part and shipping! Thanks PartSelect! Read less"

The first parts to check in this case would be all of your thermostats and thermal fuses. You can test those parts with a multi meter and they should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. If those parts are fine, you should then go on to testing your heating element as well. You can also test that with a multi meter and it should be reading  between 0 - 50 ohms. Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The thermostat and Bracket assembly PartSelect Number PS4276292 and the High Limit Thermostat ,PartSelect Number PS4205217 on the element housing.

Samsung service says the error code means heating element, but after reading the description of what this part is suppose to solve (if the heating element is burned, dryer does not heat or over heats, or clothes take to long to dry), the dryer does not stay on and an error code comes up.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Josie,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Yes, the HE error code is in relation to the heating element not working correctly.  If your are getting the HE error code and the dryer is shutting off, see if the circuit breaker for the dryer has been tripped.  If so, you will need to unplug the dryer and check the wire connections between the electronic control board and the heating element.  If there are any loose wires reconnect them. If the wire harness or the heating element appears damaged replace them.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer is running but it isn't producing any heat. I replaced the heating element last year. Should i replace it again?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Calvin, thank you for your question. The heating element rarely goes bad. I would recommend testing the thermostats and fuse to determine if one of those parts are faulty. A faulty thermostat can cause the unit to run, but not heat. Testing the thermostats is a very easy job. Set your multimeter to the R X 1 setting. Take each of your meter's probes and touch one to each terminal. You are testing for continuity, and you should receive a reading of either zero or infinity. At room temperature, testing the thermostat should produce a reading of zero. But if a thermostat is tested when it is heated to its limit, a reading of infinity should be produced. We strongly recommend that you test your thermostat at room temperature. If the test you conduct with your thermostat does not produce these results, then you should replace the component. If the thermostats are tested and are fine, the element should be replaced. I hope this helps!"

Unplug the dryer and reconnect any loose wiring connections on the gas valve coils. Replace the wire harness if damaged. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Willians, thank you for your question. Looking at your model information there are a few parts that you should take out and test to see which one is giving you the issue. The first parts to check in this case would be all of your thermostats and thermal fuses. You can test those parts with a multi meter and they should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. If all of those parts are fine then the issue might actually be in your control board. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

First I very carefully ordered all parts possibly associated with this problem. Watched all videos available for this model. Could not find one at Parts Select that addressed this particular dryer. Model number was correct. Finally found YouTube video that addressed an \"Old Kenmore Wood Top\". It showed the correct way to remove the Heating Element unit. Also Parts Select never mentions that fuses and sensors are not \"polarized\". Very important info for a novice. But Google helped me with that. Heating Element is \"polarized\", very important not to cross wires. I did order a couple Heating Element Connection Wire Kits that were not needed for this repair. Got all parts replaced, put dryer back together, crossed my fingers and turned it on, so far it has been working really well. I chose to replace all the parts I did because of the dryers age, plus I am not familiar with multimeters. Didn't want to risk one old part messing up a new part. Thank you Parts Select.It is not a 2 hr. repair, but I worked slowly, didn't want to make any mistakes. It would be good if everyone is aware of some of the above information and the YouTube video done by an individual on this particular dryer. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "*as with all electrical repairs I unplugged dryer from the outlet*I disconnected the wires to the heating element, removed the 2 nut screws holding the heating element in place and removed the defective heating element. It looked like the heating element had darkened on the lower end and the wire terminals definitely looked li ke they had built some resistance that lead to the connection wire melting. I slid the new heating element in and replaced the 2 screws. I cut the melted portion of the connection wire about 1/2\" beyond the melted area and stripped the wire jacket exposing clean wire. I took the connection kit & clean wire lead, divided the wires into 2 groups on each end and braided them together and twisted them to a hand tight grouping. I then took the lead cap and twisted into onto the braided wire connection until it was also hand tight and snug. I then reconnected the heating element connection wire back to the terminal end of the heating element and made sure all connections were snug. I plugged the dryer back in, reset the dryer by turning the dial to a timed setting then back to off. I set the heat to low turned the dial to a time dry and turned on the dryer to ensure the element heated up and that the wired connection was secure. After 20 - 30 seconds, the element maintained heat and no issues were found with the fixed wire. I replaced the dryer back and all screws and reconnected the vent hose. Dryer has worked great for the last few weeks with no issues. I was really surprised it was that easy to fix. Read less"

First I very carefully ordered all parts possibly associated with this problem. Watched all videos available for this model. Could not find one at Parts Select that addressed this particular dryer. Model number was correct. Finally found YouTube video that addressed an \"Old Kenmore Wood Top\". It showed the correct way to remove the Heating Element unit. Also Parts Select never mentions that fuses and sensors are not \"polarized\". Very important info for a novice. But Google helped me with that. Heating Element is \"polarized\", very important not to cross wires. I did order a couple Heating Element Connection Wire Kits that were not needed for this repair. Got all parts replaced, put dryer back together, crossed my fingers and turned it on, so far it has been working really well. I chose to replace all the parts I did because of the dryers age, plus I am not familiar with multimeters. Didn't want to risk one old part messing up a new part. Thank you Parts Select.It is not a 2 hr. repair, but I worked slowly, didn't want to make any mistakes.

I am not a mechanic in the least, trust me, if I can do it then anyone can. you will need regular Philips screw driver and one short one, really short, mine is about 2 inches in length, also I used manual one, allot of plastic, so I would not recommend electric drill or electric driver. also a good pair of plyers, but small not large.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jeff, great question. If your dryer is displaying error code E64 that indicates there is a problem somewhere in the heating element circuit. Start by unplugging your appliance, and then checking the wiring between the heating element and the control board. If any connections are loose make sure you secure them, and if the wire harness is damaged that will need to be replaced. You will then want to inspect the heating element for damage, if there is no visible damage it can also be tested for continuity with a multi-meter. When testing if it is electrically open it will need to be replaced. I hope this helps, if you have any further questions please let us know!"

If i clear the error and restart it continues to heat and dryer.  If it is heating ok would it be the heating element?  Thank you",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Brad, thank you for your question. Looking at your model information there are a few parts that you should take out and test to see which one is giving you the issue. The first parts to check in this case would be all of your thermostats and thermal fuses. You can test those parts with a multi meter and they should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. If those parts are fine, you should then go on to testing your heating element as well. You can also test that with a multi meter and it should be reading  between 0 - 50 ohms. Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello David, thank you for your question. The error code E64 means Heater Open Circuit. This error appears when the Heating element or wiring to the heating element is defective. To clear the error code  press and hold the far left key under the display and âcancelâ buttons simultaneously for 3 seconds. If the error appears again then youâll need to check heater coils and connections for open circuits. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Andres,\n\nThank you for your question. If your element is showing anywhere between 0 and 50 ohms of resistance when you test it. That would mean that it is working. If you see anything else, then your part will have to be replaced. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Alan, thank you for your question. The heating element should be reading  between 0 - 50 ohms. So by your 51 ohms reading, it is likely your element is the issue. Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. Good luck with your repair."

After getting rid of the rat and decomposition, we sanitized the entire housing with soap & chlorine bleach. Reassembly was uneventful and relatively easy.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Veronica,\n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest doing a couple tests on some of the main parts that usually go out in a situation like this. You can use a multi meter. I would say first test your M series coils, then your thermostats, and then your igniter, and radiant flame sensor. Those are the most common parts to go out. All of them should read 0 ohms when testing them. The igniter however should test anywhere between 50 and 400 ohms of resistance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Hal,\nThank you for your inquiry.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the coils, the internal bias thermostat, The igniter kit, the radiant flame sensor, the high limit thermostat, and the thermal cut-off.  I hope this helps.

When the igniter reaches a high enough temperature, these coils work together to let the gas enter the dryer. The coils may test within specifications when cold but when they get hot from the current to open them, they become too weak to open the gas valve. Hope this helps!"

At that time I found this website to purchase and install a couple of the baffles that were missing. This time, I checked the troubleshooting for my current problem and ordered all of the parts I felt I needed to resolve the problem. Once I received the parts, I followed the great how-to videos by Steve to disassemble the front of the dryer and remove the drum. I could not get to the repairs right away since the interior of the dryer was quite dirty and I took a lot of time to clean it out. Once I got to removing and replacing the drum rollers, idler pulley, rear drum felt shaft, and drum belt, everything went smoothly and was just as easy as Steve described in the videos. If I didn't have such a dirty machine interior, removing the old parts and installing the new parts would have taken less than an hour. I had to hold off on installing the front glide kit and front drum felt seal since I forgot to order two of each (I'll install these at a later date.

        "repairInstruction": "Tools required: Stubby socket wrench, 5/16\" socket, 1/2\" socket, 1/4\" socket, #3 Phillips screwdriver, external circlip pliers, straight slip joint pliers. A decently strong electric screwdriver is highly recommended - Milwaukee 2401-20 M12 cordless 1/4\" Hex Screwdriver, for example.Unplug the dryer. Turn off the gas supply. r />Remove the screws holding the door hinges to the dryer.Remove the door and hinges from the dryer by pulling the door and hinges up, then out.Remove the two plastic thingies (door stops), opposite of where the hinges were, from the front panel of the dryer. Each plastic piece is held in place by two screws.Grasp the front panel by its top edge, pull it toward you, then lift the panel up and off the clips at the bottom.There are a couple metal brackets holding the top of the dryer down to the front shroud (the doorway) and frame, one on either side. Each bracket is held in place by two screws. Remove the screws, remove the brackets, then rock the top panel up and back, like the hood of a car.Remove the screws holding the shroud to the frame. Look carefully. There are two screws that look like they hold the shroud to the frame, but actually do not. Don't remove these screws yet.Remove the screws holding the plastic duct / lint screen slot to the shroud. These are very long.Disconnect the wires from the door switch.Remove the shroud.Remember the two screws I referenced previously, stating they shouldn't yet be removed? Now's the time to remove them. Do so, then set the panel aside, being careful not to damage any wires. Don't lose the rubber gasket sitting around the circular portion of the duct.There's a metal cover over the blower wheel. This cover is held in place by a bunch of screws. Remove them all, then remove the cover.Remove the circlip going around the blower shaft, in front of the blower wheel.Remove the clamp from around the blower wheel and shaft.Pull the blower wheel off the shaft.Install the new blower wheel.Reinstall the clamp around the blower wheel and shaft.Reinstall the circlip.Reinstall the metal blower cover.Make sure the rear of the drum is resting on the wheels.Now things become a little difficult, because you have to fight the drum a little bit. Put the panel containing the moisture sensor, front drum seal, and duct into position. (Be careful not to mess up the drum glides. Make sure the rubber seal at the bottom of the vent is in place, sealing the vent to the blower.) Screw the panel into place with two screws, but don't fully tighten yet.There's a felt seal that is supposed to go between the rear lip of the drum and the rear inside wall. The seal is supposed to be held folded, pinched between the lip and the wall, with the edge of the seal being outside the drum. The seal isn't supposed to jut into the inside of the drum. Use your fingers and some other tool to push the rear felt drum seal out of the inside of the drum. If you use a screwdriver, be careful that you don't cut, rip, or otherwise damage the felt seal.Do the same with the front felt drum seal.Carefully inspect the felt seals. You don't want any portion of the seal somehow working its way back into the inside of the drum. Then verify again that the rubber seal that goes between the blower housing and the vent is in place and properly sealing. Now tighten the screws.Connect the wires to the door switch on the shroud, then loosely screw the shroud in place. Screw the shroud to the vent. Once all the screws are in place, tighten all the screws.Lower the top of the dryer into position.Hook a bracket into one side of the lid, position the bracket over the front shroud, then screw in place.Repeat with the other bracket.Place the front panel onto the bottom clips. Seat the panel onto the clips all the way, then rock the panel forward into place.Install the plastic door stops.Insert the door hinges into their slots, push the door down to seat into place, then install the screws that hold the hinges in place.Plug the dryer in, turn on the gas, test.

Tightening the wheel may result in the breaking of the center hub. If these are not the issues, you may need to check the drive motor, part number PS3500893, to fix the issue. If the drive motor is faulty and is running faster than the normal speed, it may result in the breaking of the wheel. We hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

Once the unit was out, it was a bit difficult removing the top and back panel to gain access to the fan motor (all of that is on top on our fridge). Once I gained access, replacing the fan motor was relatively simple. Although the video on Parts Select showed a model where the fan motor was located in the freezer compartment, the rest of the instructions in the video for changing out the fan motor and splicing the new motor wires to the existing wire harness (different connection) were very helpful. I was glad I purchased new rubber bumpers and grommets and a new compression ring to hold the fan in place. The old rubber grommets were pretty worn. I also took the opportunity to vacuum out all the dust that had accumulated over the years in areas that aren't accessible from the front. The next most difficult part of the repair was maneuvering the unit back into the cabinet. Probably would have been easier if I had a helper.

Thank you part #ps1483567",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Richard, Thank you for your inquiry. The fan is designed to operate anytime the compressor is operating, and the compressor runs when the temperature sensor signals that the temperature inside the fridge rises above it's set point, so it will start the cycle to push the air through the fridge and cool it off, so if the condenser fan is running continuously, the fridge may be getting warmer more quickly than normal.

Next, remove the lint screen and two screws holding the lint screen housing to the lid. Remove the two side moldings on the control panel and the two screws holding doun the enclosure. Slide the control enclosure forward and lift up . Ta ke a picture of the wiring for later reference and carefully unplug the wires and set the enclosure aside. Next, remove the two screws holding the rear lid retaining clips. Gently pry up on the front of the lid to realese hold doun clips, swing the lid up and remove it from the rear clips, set the lid aside. Remove the two screws on corners of front cover located near the top, unplug the door switch. Remove the front cover by lifting straight up, set aside. Now remove the belt from the motor by realeasing the tensioner and remove it from the drum. You can now remove the drum through the front. Now is a good time to check the condition of your drum rollers, clean them as needed or replace them. Clean the roller shafts and apply a quality grease. \"Clean the roller groove on the drum\" this is what makes the drum sound bumpy! Remove the rear seal and replace it as per the instructions that come with the seal. The glue dries quickly, so have the seal fully in place and apply glue to small areas replacing the seal fully before moving on. You can now reinstall the drum being careful not to damage the seal. Place the drum on the rollers, reach inside and work the seal into place. You can now replace the belt and work in reverse with the casings! It took me longer to type these instructions than it did to make this repair! Enjoy your like new machine! Read less"

        "storyTitle": "After a period of the dryer not being used, the idler pulley wheel froze up on the shaft of the idler pulley arm.",
        "repairInstruction": "This should have been a simple repair, but turned out to be time consuming and moderately difficult. I hope these instructions will help anyone who encounters the problems described here. After a period of the dryer not being used, the idler pulley wheel froze on the shaft of the idler pulley arm, so I needed to replace both parts. After mounting the new wheel and two washers on the new arm and securing with a retaining ring, I went to install this assembly by going in through the small access panel at the rear of the dryer. I slid the belt off the old idler pulley wheel and unhooked the spring from the idler pulley arm; the arm was mounted on a sleeve fastened to the motor bracket by one screw. All that should have been necessary was to back out that screw and replace the old idler pulley assembly with the new one. That is where the trouble started. Backing out the screw with a socket driver, I found it would go a few turns, then start to bind. I tried turning it in and out to get the threads to engage, but it kept binding. Eventually I gave the screw a hard turn, and then it would turn freely but not move in or out. Looking on the internet for advice, I found a video that asserts for another model Maytag dryer using the same type of mounting for the idler arm, that there is a design flaw. You can find the video by searching for âMaytag dryer idler pulley defectâ. According to the video, the sheet metal screw used to mount the idler pulley arm can gradually loosen due to the pressure and vibration, and begins to âwaggleâ which eventually damages the threads. I believe this is what happened to my dryer. The video suggests replacing the sheet metal screw with a machine screw and nut for a more durable union. So now I understood how the screw could be stripped just sitting in the dryer, but that didnât help me get the screw out. Working through the rear access panel, I tried pulling on the screw head with several types of pliers, pushing the point from behind with a piece of wood while turning the head with a socket driver; eventually I was able to use a pry bar under the screw head and sleeve to apply pressure while turning the head, and with that method the screw backed out. With the screw removed, it could be seen that the threads in the middle part of the thread length were almost completely worn away. The screw sleeve got somewhat deformed in this process so I ordered a new one, along with an exact replacement sheet metal screw, hoping the threads in the hole were still intact. With the old idler pulley arm now removed, I could transfer the old idler bracket spacer to the new idler pulley arm. When the ordered parts arrived and I tried to mount the idler pulley arm, the new screw would go in only a couple of turns before binding. Rather than risk winding up in the same situation by forcing the screw, I decided to use a machine screw and nut instead. The original sheet metal screw was a #10. A machine screw the same size would not fit through the hole, and I could not fit my drill into the dryer cabinet in a position to enlarge the hole, so I used a #8 machine screw with a nut and lock washer. First I put some grease on the contact areas of the screw sleeve and idler bracket spacer, then inserted the machine screw through the hole and put the lock washer and nut on the other side of the mounting. The space around the nut is very limited, and most of my tools were too large to hold the nut while the screw was tightened. It was too small for a socket or adjustable wrench, and the clearance from the exhaust duct was too small for the handles of most tools. Eventually, I found a needle nose pliers with short handles that did the job. A thin open end wrench might also work. Then I reconnected the spring and belt to the idler pulley assembly, and closed the access panel. So far the dryer works, but if the #8 screw turns out to be not strong enough, I could get an extension for my drill and enlarge the hole to fit a #10 machine screw and nut. Looking back on the job, the most difficult part of this repair was removing the damaged screw. This and several other steps might have been a lot easier if I had removed the motor bracket (where the idler pulley arm is mounted) from the dryer and worked outside the cabinet. Part Select has an excellent video âReplacing the Drive Motorâ that shows how to do this. It would be a lot of disassembly work, but for someone with good assembly skills could be easier in the long run. Hopefully most folks out there who replace the idler pulley arm on a dryer will find an easier situation than I did. But for any who have to deal with a stripped mounting screw, I hope this summary will help you resolve it. Read less"

At that time I found this website to purchase and install a couple of the baffles that were missing. This time, I checked the troubleshooting for my current problem and ordered all of the parts I felt I needed to resolve the problem. Once I received the parts, I followed the great how-to videos by Steve to disassemble the front of the dryer and remove the drum. I could not get to the repairs right away since the interior of the dryer was quite dirty and I took a lot of time to clean it out. Once I got to removing and replacing the drum rollers, idler pulley, rear drum felt shaft, and drum belt, everything went smoothly and was just as easy as Steve described in the videos. If I didn't have such a dirty machine interior, removing the old parts and installing the new parts would have taken less than an hour. I had to hold off on installing the front glide kit and front drum felt seal since I forgot to order two of each (I'll install these at a later date.

        "repairInstruction": ". I had replaced the idler pulley a number of years ago so I assumed that the noise was now due to either the sliders at the front of the drum or bad rollers at the back.. I removed power by turning off the breaker that serviced the dryer. After removing the lower front panel via the two sheet metal screws at the bottom I then removed the door panel. The safety switch behind the door had to be removed by depressing the sides of the switch after disconnecting the two push on connectors. One will discover that reconnecting the smaller of the two contacts to the unused contact on the switch will allow one to run the dryer with the door off or open. This can be useful to test operation after the repair is complete before reassembling the door and lower panels. I then removed the large panel that secures the front of the drum. The drum is then removed after releasing tension on the drive belt. All rotating parts and sliders could then be checked. Upon disassembly I found that the rollers and sliders appeared ok and decided to replace the idler pulley as a last attempt to fix the problem. This is best done by removing the tension arm and tensioning spring. the pulley is then more easily removed from the arm using snap ring pliers. After replacing the pulley and thrust washer with new parts I reassembled everything. I found it helpful to pretension the arm using a zip tie wrap in that the belt can be more easily reinstalled on the drum and pulley. When the drum and belt is properly in place and belt threaded, one can reach in with a pair of cutters and snip the tie wrap to re tension the system. The dryer has been running normally again for a week after affecting this repair. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Relocating dishwasher into the new kitchen layout",
        "repairInstruction": "In this case the dishwasher had already been installed for a few years. After removing it, we inspected it and saw it needed a bit of TLC. The transport wheels on the back were missing, making it harder to move around without scratching the tile and some of the original hardware was rusted or broken off. I looked up the parts easily he re on PartsSelect using their parts breakdown diagrams and was glad to see what I needed was still available. We had a licensed plumber relocate the hot water line and drain for us to make things a bit easier.A licensed electrician had also moved the power line over to the new location and left a wire sticking out of the bottom of the wall to hardwire the dishwasher in again. We decided to convert the dishwasher to be able to be plugged into a standard 20amp wall outlet instead. We had already purchased a kit with a nice long cord and strain-relief snap on plastic fitting that snapped onto the metal incoming power box on the bottom front of the dishwasher. Using the supplied wire nuts, etc., we connected the wires and ground wire to the proper wires from the dishwasher and ground lug. We put the dishwasher aside and then went to work on converting the power wire coming out of the bottom of the wall, to a conventional outlet. I am mentioning all this because in our first attempt we unfortunately put the receptacle a bit high off the floor and the new power cord plug end, stuck out and hit the back of the dishwasher so it would not go all the way in and was sticking out from under the counter top. I tried using one of those flat adapter cables, but even that still stuck out to far. So we ended up relocating the outlet box as low as we could on the wall and this allowed the plug to stick out into the opening area at the bottom rear area of the dishwasher so it could now be slid all the way in under the kitchen counter properly. I hope that bit of trial and error will save you some time if you ever decide to go the pluggable route too.The new installation required the use of the dishwasher side mount brackets, so we had to purchase a replacement set of those, complete with the hardware to screw them down.This project took a bit longer than planned due to the power plug problem, one which we will remember for any other similar appliance relocation projects, as well as the time to get our new parts in that we had to order, but other than that the rest went smoothly and the dishwasher was relocated successfully.

Then I figured it was this part - the motor coupling. I unplugged the machine and took out the drain tube. I leaned the machine back and propped it up with an empty detergent bottle, because those were abundant. Ratchet off a few bolts and the motor comes out. The coupling was indeed broken. The new one slips right in - I tapped it a few times with a mallet for good measure / vengeance. Ratcheted the bolts back on and tipped it back up. Pros: Washer works now.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Eric,\n\nThanks for your question. Number 020 is the yellow catch. Number 022 is the blue catch. Number 025 is the green catch. If the catch you are replacing has an 18 on it or if it is silver, use the 020 yellow catch. If nothing matches check if your dryer has one catch, and make sure it is not a 27\" Wide Laundry Center or a Commercial Stacked Pair and if that is true, use the 020 yellow catch. If it is either of those types of machines, use the 025 green catch. If your dryer has two catches, use the 022 blue catch on the top and the 020 yellow catch on the bottom.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer will not start when i push the start button.  I have already replaced the door switch, but that did not fix the problem.  Here is what's happening;  when i have the dryer set to start and close the door, the dryer makes a soft whirring/clicking sound.  When i push the start button, there is a loud click, the whirring stops, but the dryer does not start.  Do these symptoms give any indication of which part might be faulty?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Erin,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a couple of other parts that you would check to see if they are working correctly. The first part I would actually suggest testing is your start switch. You may also want to test your thermal fuse as well. You can test both parts with a multi meter to see what the continuity is on them. If both of those parts are fine you might go on to test your thermostats and your element as well. If those parts are fine then it may be your timer that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

I will order the latch anyway but I am wondering if anything else could be wrong? In addition, the light burned out. Does it require the exact replacement bulb?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Gerald,\n\nThanks for your question. The door catch kit would be the most likely solution for your problem based on your description. As for the bulb, we are only showing one bulb that is compatible with your machine based on the manufacturer's part list.\n\nI hope this helps."

The catch can be swapped to the other side yes but it sounds like there could be an issue with the door switch,PartSelect Number PS3653055.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Morgan, thank you for your question. These would be the instructions from the manufacturer: This kit contains (2) door strikes and various door catches. Some dryers may use more than (1) catch. Note numbers stamped on the catches and/or color of the spring steel, 20 (yellow), 22 (blue) or 25 (green). Match the number and/or color, of the catch being replaced with the catch supplied in the kit. If the catch youâre replacing has an 18 stamped on it or is silver in color, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. The (2) door strikes contained in the kit are the same. Please replace the door strike(s) with the appropriate number of door catches being used for this repair. If you cannot match the number on the catches, match the catch(es) by the following: 1. If your dryer has one catch and is not a 27â Wide Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. If it is a 27â Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 25 (green) for replacement. 2. If your dryer has 2 catches, use the catch stamped with 22 (blue) on the top and the catch stamped 20 (yellow) on the bottom.  I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Warren, \nThank you for your inquiry.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the thermal fuse, the door catch and strike, the internal bias thermostat, the drive belt,  the idler pulley and the drive motor.  I hope this helps.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Pius, if you are experiencing problems with your buzzer shutting off, that would be a motor switch issue.

Your site states that the door catch could cause this problem. The door stays latched so is there any other way to determine if the catch is the problem?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Irvin, thank you for your question. When you are experiencing an issue like this there are a few parts that you will have to test to determine what is causing your issue. For all of these parts you can test them with a multi meter. First you will have to test your thermostats and thermal fuses to make sure they are all functioning correctly. After that you will want to test parts in this order, your m series coils, igniter itself, or your radiant flame sensor. You may also want to check your regulator just to make sure that part is functioning properly as well.  Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. The door catch could be a problem but only if you see that the part is physically broken. You would want to check the door lock to make sure that it is locking correctly (this is the part that the door catch/strike goes into, to signal your appliance that the door is safely shut.) I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

It is recommended that the door strike, PartSelect number PS266893, be replaced, as the missing prong may be causing this issue and is not allowing the interlock switch to register that the door is closed. You may also want to check the door interlock switch as well, to be sure there are no underlying issues with the switch itself. We hope this helps."

When I emailed customer service to complain, I never received any response. I can't believe that customer service can be so unimportant in such a competitive marketplace. And with the power of social media, you would think customer service would be a big differentiator.I ended having to buy another part (the igniter). I found a different vendor with better prices and a commitment to satisfying customers. I got my part in 3 days for cheaper shipping than the starting point of Parts Select shipping.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Larry, thank you for the great question. WD-40 only protects metal from rust and corrosion, penetrates stuck parts, displaces moisture, and lubricates almost anything, so it may provide a temporary solution. For squealing sounds, it is advised to look for any wear on the idler pulley. If you come across scoring marks, then it is one of the signs of a bad idler pulley. We recommend you replace the idler pulley, part number PS334244, since a worn-out idler pulley may damage the drive belt if used for longer durations. We hope this information helps!"

Next, remove the lint screen and two screws holding the lint screen housing to the lid. Remove the two side moldings on the control panel and the two screws holding doun the enclosure. Slide the control enclosure forward and lift up . Ta ke a picture of the wiring for later reference and carefully unplug the wires and set the enclosure aside. Next, remove the two screws holding the rear lid retaining clips. Gently pry up on the front of the lid to realese hold doun clips, swing the lid up and remove it from the rear clips, set the lid aside. Remove the two screws on corners of front cover located near the top, unplug the door switch. Remove the front cover by lifting straight up, set aside. Now remove the belt from the motor by realeasing the tensioner and remove it from the drum. You can now remove the drum through the front. Now is a good time to check the condition of your drum rollers, clean them as needed or replace them. Clean the roller shafts and apply a quality grease. \"Clean the roller groove on the drum\" this is what makes the drum sound bumpy! Remove the rear seal and replace it as per the instructions that come with the seal. The glue dries quickly, so have the seal fully in place and apply glue to small areas replacing the seal fully before moving on. You can now reinstall the drum being careful not to damage the seal. Place the drum on the rollers, reach inside and work the seal into place. You can now replace the belt and work in reverse with the casings! It took me longer to type these instructions than it did to make this repair! Enjoy your like new machine! Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Phyllis,\n\nThanks for your question. There are a few different parts you will want to examine, depending on where the noise is coming from First we would advise to check the blower belt and the drum belt to see if they are damaged or worn. Also examine the drum support rollers for signs of wear and tear.  The idler pulley arm is also a common cause and should be checked for wear and tear - the drive belt is commonly replaced alongside the pulley.\n\nIf all else fails, the drive motor could be the cause, but this is rarely the case.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "storyTitle": "The dryer had been squeaking for at least 6 months when it finally became painfully loud and unacceptable",
        "repairInstruction": ". I had replaced the idler pulley a number of years ago so I assumed that the noise was now due to either the sliders at the front of the drum or bad rollers at the back.. I removed power by turning off the breaker that serviced the dryer. After removing the lower front panel via the two sheet metal screws at the bottom I then removed the door panel. The safety switch behind the door had to be removed by depressing the sides of the switch after disconnecting the two push on connectors. One will discover that reconnecting the smaller of the two contacts to the unused contact on the switch will allow one to run the dryer with the door off or open. This can be useful to test operation after the repair is complete before reassembling the door and lower panels. I then removed the large panel that secures the front of the drum. The drum is then removed after releasing tension on the drive belt. All rotating parts and sliders could then be checked. Upon disassembly I found that the rollers and sliders appeared ok and decided to replace the idler pulley as a last attempt to fix the problem. This is best done by removing the tension arm and tensioning spring. the pulley is then more easily removed from the arm using snap ring pliers. After replacing the pulley and thrust washer with new parts I reassembled everything. I found it helpful to pretension the arm using a zip tie wrap in that the belt can be more easily reinstalled on the drum and pulley. When the drum and belt is properly in place and belt threaded, one can reach in with a pair of cutters and snip the tie wrap to re tension the system. The dryer has been running normally again for a week after affecting this repair. Read less"

Check the roller wheels the drum rests on to see if they are wore down as well. If everything checks out fine you may need to replace the Motor, PartSelect Number PS11739459. Hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Cary, thank you for your question. Turn the pulley wheel by hand. If the wheel barely turns or does not turn at all, the bearing is bad. If the bearing is bad, remove the pulley bracket from the dryer. Unhook the spring and slide out the bracket. Add a few drops of bearing oil where the axle and the wheel meet. Do this on both sides. Turn the wheel by hand and if the bearing is salvageable, it will begin to turn freely after several turns. If it does not turn freely, the pulley wheel must be replaced. We hope this helps."

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Dyer made a squealing/screeching noise",
        "repairInstruction": "I have read other postings which describe most of the procedure very well, so I'm just going to add things that should be considered, which I have not read about here. Removing the drum proved difficult due to the lack of room on the two sides.The vent blower motor bracket is at the front bottom of the dryer, and when the two screws on either the left or right side are removed, the dryer sides spread more easily and allow the drum to be removed or re-installed more easily. Next, the rear drum bearing I bought has a rubber o-ring which holds it in place. There is a good chance this o-ring will be hard and brittle after years of service, and will crumble when removed, in order to replace the bearing. I had to run to the local hardware store to get a new o-ring, and could only find one that did was not rated for high heat usage. I presumed once the drum is re-installed that the bearing can't dislodge even with a missing o-ring. I think it just holds the bearing in place while removing and re-installing the drum, but I cannot be certain about this.So if you plan to replace the rear drum bearing, make sure to also order the o-ring that holds it in place. It is doubtful you can re-use the old one depending on the age of your dryer.Replacing the old white belt tensioning pulley requires the removal and re-installation of a \"nut\" that has no threads. It is forced on and off and not simple to re-install. The removal was easy simply by using a wrench to \"unscrew\" it counterclockwise. But re-installing it is another matter. It requires force to get it back onto the shaft. I saw a tip to use a 7/16\" socket placed over the nut and hit with a hammer while bracing the bracket from the other side. I did this by used a smaller tool, linesman's pliers, which provided the force needed. Install it about 1/4\" past the end of the bracket shaft. Careful, that nut has sharp edges and I ended up bleeding from that process. Three hands would help: one to brace the bracket, one to hold the nut and socket in place, and one to hammer. So good luck with that. Probably there is a smarter way to do this.If you replace the old white plastic belt tensioning pulley with a new yellow one, it is not simple to understand how to re-install the belt properly. The videos do not do the trick adequately. I did find one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an \"aha moment\". Since you cannot see the belt, the pulleys, the motor, or anything else during installation, it is not a simple thing to do. Here are my tips: Before re-installing the drum, move the belt tensioning pulley bracket to the right (when facing the dryer front) and you will see a little spot where the bracket will stay to the right when engaged in this spot. Engage the bracket and then proceed to re-install the drum. That way, when you reach under the drum to set the belt properly on the pulleys, you won't have to engage the tensioning bracket without being able to see. Once the belt is in place, carefully remove the bracket from the right holding spot and allow it to move back to the left operating position. I used two hands and don't think I could have done it with one. When the belts are new, they can be naturally twisted and you have to be careful to install the belt with no twist. I had to do it twice to get it right. If someone can take up the top belt slack for you, it's easy to feel the belt underneath the drum and get any twists out.Next, i had a hard time inserting the drum back into the dryer and finding the hole where the bearing inserts. The problem is, if you are not careful, it's easy to move, bend, or break the heater wires which surround the hole you need to locate blindly and slip the drum bearing into. I did bend those wires, but luckily not break them. In hindsight, applying some masking tape to the rear inside panel of the dryer right at the top, left and right of the drum BEFORE removing the drum would have made it much easier estimating the proper drum height while maneuvering the bearing into the rear hole. Then remove the masking tape when done. I ordered a new top plastic front bearing that supports the drum in the front. Good thing I did because mine was split about 5\" where one set of the green and white sliders install. I had one white \"plastic\" insert visible. The other one plus the two green bearings were totally missing. No wonder it was squealing.Finally, the hardest part for me was re-installing the top of the dryer! Take a good look before removing it so you can see exactly how the top fits to the dryer and how the parts need to be lined up first. Thanks to PartSelect.com! Every part was correct and the installation videos gave me so much help. Also, parts arrived in two days, which surprised me. I will be ordering all parts here. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Betty, Thank you for the great question. The noise could be a number of things. First it is good to check the belt. Make sure it is not rubbing or needs to be replaced.While you are checking the belt you can check the Idler Pulley the belt sits on. Make sure the wheel is in good condition and not damaged. You will also need to check the Front Drum Bearing and the Slides. The slides will wear down over time and if not replaced the tabs on the bearing will also wear off and the bearing will need to be replaced with the slides. There is also a Felt Seal that attaches to the bottom half of the drum on the front. This prevent the drum from rubbing and causing the noise as well. If you are replacing the Front Drum Bearing and Slides it is a good idea to replace the Felt at the same time. If all of these parts check out then the problem would be the Rear Drum Bearing Kit. Hope this helps!"

Thanks, carroll",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Carroll,\nThank you for your question.  There are some other parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  There is a felt strip in the back of the drum that runs along the bottom of the tub that may have come off.  If it came off and moved towards the front of the drum, it can rub against the metal at the front of the dryer and cause this noise.  Another part that may cause the noise you are hearing is the motor.  If a load of clothes in the dryer is too heavy it can cause strain on the motor and also cause the noise you are hearing.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "storyTitle": "dryer made squeaking noise when first starting to run",
        "repairInstruction": "I first watched the video and disassembled the dryer to see if I could determine what part was squeaking. All looked good except the wheel on the Idler lever which was tight. I vacuumed up the years of lint and reassembled the dryer and waited for the parts to arrive. I ordered the idler lever and also the 2 drum support wheels, belt and 2 drum guides since I thought that is was a good idea to go ahead and replace these parts once I had the dryer disassembled again. Good choice on the belt as once I removed the old belt there was a crack on the underside of the belt. I bought snap ring pliers at home depot but the tips were too big to fit the holes on the snap rings on the drum rollers. I bought another snap ring plier set from an automotive store that came wth 5 snap ring attachments - but again all were too large to fit the snap rings on the drum support rollers. I used a nail and small screwdriver to expand and pull off the snap rings but this approach was frustrating and time consuming. Not sure where to get snap ring pliers that are small enough to fit the holes on the snap rings - so hope that you have better luck locating a set thats small enough! I was able to return the pliers that I purchased - so all good. I was surprised at how easy the dryer came apart and how easy it was easy to work on. When disassembling the dryer - we took pictures of the wire connections before we disconnected them, however at one point we tilted the dryer back to clean behind it and the top slipped a little away from the side panel of the dryer and one of the wires that was connect to the wire block that is up by where the power cord connects cam loose - and it took some time to find and figure out a wiring diagram for this connection. Suggest that you take a pictire of this wire connection block once you lift the lid - just in case a slip occurs and a wire may disconnect. When replacing the idler lever - have a little grease available when you install the new idler lever (between the arm and the bolt area as it constantly moves and the old brease has probably worn away) . After making these repairs I dont think I will ever buy a new dryer as any part , including the heater and motor would be easy to replace and cheaper than a new dryer. Read less"

You can easily clean the vent by using the following instructions:\n1. The lint filter in front of the dryer, open the door, and pull the lint filter straight up.\n2. Do not use water to remove the lint from the lint filter. Just pull the lint from the filter with your fingers and dispose of it.\n3. Using a vacuum crevice tool, you can carefully clean inside the lint trap to further ensure proper airflow and efficient drying.\n4. If your lint filter does have residue on it, you can clean it by wetting a nylon brush with hot water and liquid detergent. Scrub both sides of the lint filter. Rinse both sides thoroughly with hot water, then thoroughly dry with a clean towel. Inspect the lint filter to make sure you have removed all residue. Repeat as needed. Dry the lint filter fully.\nIf the issue still persists, replace the lint filter, part number PS11763056, to fix the issue. We hope this information is useful!"

        "repairInstruction": "I noticed that drying time was increasing. I took the covers off the dryer to reach the fan and discovered that the squirrel cage fan buckets were packed with lint, and therefore not moving the air as intended. This was because the original lint filter caught most of the lint, but some bypassed the lint filter and then built up in the fan wheel buckets. The lint bypassed the lint filter because there was no felt gasket on the original filter as far as I can tell. I replaced the lint filter...and the replacement filter includes the felt seal (and fits tightly in the slide). The original lint filter has a provision for the felt seal, but I don't recall ever seeing it (and I did not see remnants of it in the fan or duct). As a matter of fact, I was always suspicious of how loosely the lint filter fit in the slide. The felt seal is not available as a replacement part from Maytag. That said, felt material 3/16\"x1/2\"x10ft is available from McMaster-Carr...and it fits nicely in the original lint filter. Read less"

It can fix the problem, however it could also be an issue with the heat, so I would also check the cycling and hi-limit thermostats, the blower wheel, the heating element, the venting system, and the moisture sensor. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"

Researching the model number that you have provided, there may be an issue with the lint seal part# PS11741506 or a clogged dryer vent. Since a clogged vent restricts airflow so that the air cannot move the lint to the outside of your home, it forces the lint into the area behind your dryer. Check the exhaust ducts for any clogs or restrictions, and make sure it can vent outside correctly. We hope this helps."

        "repairInstruction": "Washer/dryer belongs to a friend. Originally, the problem was that the dryer wouldnât heat, so I opened it up, and removed the drum thinking it might be the heating element. It wasnât, and the ohm reading confirmed this. It turned out to be a burnt wire connector to the element ( unknown to me, and found out later, was that the start swi tch had remained continuously in the down position because the switch was pressed too far down and thus remained locked âonâ in place under the surrounding cabinet frame. This, in my opinion, caused for a continual call for heat and thus burnt the wire.)I replaced the burnt wire/connector and reassembled. Now the dryer would heat, but would only run if the start button was continually depressed. Let go of the button, and the dryer stopped. Repair pros suggested a new start switch. I bought a new start switch along with a new interlock switch (it basically shuts off dryer if belt breaks because lack of a belt releases pressure on the pulley that keeps switch depressed.) Apparently they can go bad, too. It turns out neither of these switches were bad. Instead, upon further inspection, after the first installation of the drum belt, the L-shaped bracket which holds the pulley for belt tension became dislocated from its correct position and was not allowing for the depression of the interlock switch, causing the dryer to âreadâ broken belt, and thus, not run. I loosened the motor bracket to allow placing the bracket in the correct position. Reassembled and all was good. PSA - almost every sheet metal edge is razor sharp. In the process of returning parts.

You will need to check the door switch, the thermal fuse, the push-to start switch, the drive motor and the timer or the electronic control board (depending on what type of dryer you have).

The issue could be the start switch, but I would recommend testing the door switch and the belt interlock switch first before ordering. A faulty door or belt switch can cause this same issue.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi April,\nThank you for your question.  The push-to-start switch is held in place with tabs. Before you begin any repair please unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet.  In a situation where the button is still on the shaft of the push-to-start switch, use a piece of string to pull the button off.  Next go to the back of the appliance and remove the screws securing the back of the control panel.  Slide the control panel to the side and detach it from the main top.  Disconnect the wires from the old start switch. Take note of how they are positioned on the switch before removing them, so you can connect them correctly on the new switch.   Lift the tab and rotate the switch counter clockwise to remove it from the control panel.  Install the new switch and rotate it clockwise into position so it is secured by the tabs.  Connect the wires to the switch.  Reposition the control panel and secure it with the screws.  Then reinstall the button.  You can now plug the dryer back in and it should now work for you.   I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Gail,\nThank you for your question. Here is some information that a customer has left regarding how she installed the switch, \"Hi, I am a working mom, and my dryer quit just after it had been behaving strangely. At first, it kept spinning after the door was opened. It eventually stopped working, and I assumed that the door switch must be the culprit. I purchased the part from the catalogue, and watched the installation video. Repair: After unplugging the dryer and removing the lint screen, I used a philips head screwdriver to loosen and remove the two screws located at the lint trap. I then inserted a flat screwdriver into the area between the top of the dryer casing and the face. Per the video, at approx. 2 inches in from the left and right side. I did this while gently applying pressure from the back of the dryer top to the front. This loosens the clips allowing the top to be lifted back and out of the way. I then opened the dryer door and commenced loosening and removing the two screws that hold the dryer switch in place. I used my screwdriver to gently separate the wiring harness connection, as it also has a clip to keep the connection tight. With these items free, I simply popped the little black thingy back through the hole (The black thingy just keeps the slack in the wiring from sagging, I think). With the old part removed, I then installed the new part accordingly. I reversed my way back out of the process respectively. I plugged her back in, and turned her on. Back in business.\"  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

After adding the additional information that the dryer would run to full cycle as long as the Start switch was held in I was advised to replace the Start switch. It wasn't obvious from the wiring diagram, but if you remo ve the Start switch and look at the side it shows it contains a solenoid holding circuit that keeps the switch in the \"on\" mode as long as there is a feedback signal from the temperature overload switches. So if the dryer will run to completion if the switch is held in, replace the Start switch. If it still stops mid-cycle, replace the temperature overload switches.The replacement videos were spot on as far as clear and easy to follow instructions for the repair, and all ordered parts were delivered very quickly.Thanks for your help PartsSelect!

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Michael, thank you for your question. There are a couple of things that could cause your dryer not to start. It could be the push to start switch, part number PS11748542. You can test this part with a multi meter. Touch the black meter probe to one metal prong on the switch and the red probe to the other. Press in on the switch pole. If the meter doesn't change, the switch is bad and needs to be replaced. If the meter drops to zero, the switch is good. It could also be the timer part number PS11746606. To test the timer Look for a wiring diagram located on the back of the unit, inside the cabinet or control panel, which tells the correct Ohms range, and what contacts should be open or closed. Move the scale on the multimeter to read Rx1, and zero the multimeter by touching two probes together. Set the dial on the multimeter to read \"0\". Touch one probe to the terminal where you removed the wire and the second probe to any other contact on the timer. You should get a reading between 2000 and 3000 OHMs or in the range of the suggested reading on the diagram. If contacts open when they should be closed or closed when they should be open based on the diagram, or you get a reading out of range, replace the timer. Open contacts should read OL (Open Loop) and closed contacts should read 0. We hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Shari, thank you for your question. The terminals should be labeled with letters. Touch the one that says \"com\" with one probe and the one that says \"no\" with the other. Push down on the switch, if it does not move at all it does not have continuity and needs to be replaced. Repeat the test touching \"com\" with one probe and \"nc\" with the other. This test should show continuity (0 ohms) before the button is pressed. If it does not, the switch will need to be replaced. We hope this helps!"

The fuse is connected to the lid switch which, in turn, tells the washer whether the lid is open or closed. The switch is designed to intentionally blow the fuse if it is not working properly so that the washer won't run with the lid open. One of the contacts in the switch may be stuck or malfunctioning.It is the lid switch.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

I'm not a handyman by any means, but the tutorial showed exactly what needed to be done. It appeared simple and it was. Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Theresa, Thank you for the question. The first thing to check is the Door Catch Kit,PartSelect Number PS334230 to make sure it is staying latched and secure. If this part is lose and the door is not fully closed it will turn the dryer off.It is also a good idea to check the Door Switch Assembly,PartSelect Number: PS11742178.If the door switch and catch are good you can test the Internal-Bias Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS11741405.A cycling thermostat is in tune with the temperature of your dryer and regulates it in order to maintain a certain temperature. This thermostat reaches a temperature of 155 degrees, turns off, and then turns on again once it has dropped by 25 degrees. If your dryer is not staying on or turning off to soon this could be the issue.Hope this helps!"

The motor shoudl stay on once the switch is released.You can check the start switch  to see if there is continuity without pushing the button. If there is then this would be a faulty start switch. If the start switch is good then this will be a faulty motor. Hope this helps!"

I would test the Rotary Start Switch Part Number: WE4X881 first as this is one of the most common parts that cause this issue.  The thermostats you will want to test are the Control Thermostat Part Number: WE04X10028 the High Limit Safety Thermostat Part Number: WE4X757 and the Thermal Limiter\nPart Number: WE04X10094. These parts can all be tested with a multimeter. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Mary, thank you for your question. Looking at your model information there are a few parts that you should take out and test to see which one is giving you the issue. The first parts to check in this case would be all of your thermostats and thermal fuses. You can test those parts with a multi meter and they should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. You may also want to check your start switch itself. If those parts are fine, you should then go on to testing your heating element as well. You can also test that with a multi meter and it should be reading  between 0 - 50 ohms. Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Steve, Thank you for the question. if the appliance over heated the start switch is not the issue. I suggest cleaning out the vents and the vent tubes. Make sure they are sitting flat with no dips or bends. If the air flow is blocked it will cause the appliance to over heat. it is also a good idea to remove the front panel and clean any lint build up from the duct and inside the cabinet. Once everything is cleaned out and if you have the same issues, you will need to test the thermostats and the thermal limiter on the element housing and the blower housing to see if they are defective or where tripped when they over heated. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "Hello,  \nIf my switch is bad , would I hear a buzzing noise when I turn the switch, on?\nOr could it be something else?\nthanks",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Harry, thank you for contacting us. Based on our understanding of the issue, we would suggest you check the power supply to your dryer. Sometimes, a tripped circuit breaker might stop enough power from getting to the dryer, causing a buzzing noise. If the issue remains, the problem might be with the door switch, part number PS2330880. The door switch tells the main control board that the door is closed, and it can allow the dryer to run. When the switch becomes faulty, your dryer might not start at all, and it will make a buzzing noise. We would recommend checking the door switch for continuity using a multimeter. We hope this information helps!"

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

To change the upper bearings, you will need 2 of WE1M504 and 2 of WE1M1067. If you decide to also change the rear bearing which would be the second most common cause for the noise, the part would be WE25M40. Let us know if you have any further questions."

However it is more likely that you will have to replace either your bearing slides or your pulley. I would check all of these parts to see which one of them are causing your problem. They are all physical parts, so when you look at them you should be able to determine which one is causing the problem for you. The belt and the slides would be parts that get worn down, the pulley is just something that you turn the wheel on and you will hear if it is making the squeaking noise. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Calista, thanks for getting in touch. You will know to replace the front bearings or the support if you see any visible damage. Wear is normal, but if the parts are damaged in any way they should be replaced. I hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "The dryer is not drying loads in normal time. It is also making a noise as if something is flopping around inside as the drum turns. There is nothing in the dryer and it still makes the noise. What should I check and in what order.Thanks, Jim",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jim, Thank you for the question. You can check the belt to make sure it is not wore out and and preventing the drum to turn as it should.You can also check the Rear Drum Bearing for wear. Make sure the appliance is getting proper air flow. Clean the Lint Trap Duct Assembly and the Air Vents. You can use a Multi Meter to test the High Limit Thermostat and the Bias Thermostat as well for proper continuity. Hope this helps!"

        "customerQuestion": "A question about dryer . Once in awhile durnh a drying cycle the dryer will make a squeaking noise.And sometimes the dryer will take a long time to dry but i found the front seal was broken and not fully there.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Juan,\nThank you for your question.  The squeaking noise you are hearing is likely a worn drum support roller that needs to be replaced.  It is always recommended to replace both of them at the same time.  If your dryer is taking a long time to dry and the front seal I would recommend replacing it as this is likely causing the issue.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

You will need to check the drive belt, the idler pulley wheel, the complete duct trap assembly, the idler arm, the bearing retainer and the bearing slides.  I hope this helps.

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

BTW, your customer service is excellent.Reviewed YouTube videos.Patience is required, take your time, take photos of the wires and also make a written wiring chart. This was the flaw in my planning. Reference the schematics f rom PartsSelect to number the controls. Do NOT use masking tape to identify the wires as they will have all stuck together by the time you go to reinstall them. Most difficult process was removing and identifying the numerous wires to the back panel. They have push connectors, but some were very difficult to remove. The people doing the \"how to\" videos no doubt had them partially released and that made it look easy. Examine the connectors before removing to identify how they are captured by the connector. A paper clip \"tool\" I made enabled me to release some of the capture lugs, but some were so tight, I had to use small needle-nose pliers to open up the lug to release the wire on the connector. When reinstalling, re-tighten those connectors.Replacing the parts was much easier than the wiring disconnect/reconnect process. I'm happy to report that replacing the rear bearing and the front 2 green and 2 white shim/bearings immediately and completely solved my problem. For about $150, I restored my dryer to \"like-new\" functionality and got a lot of satisfaction from doing it. The project took about 4 hours, which could have been reduced to 2 hours had I know about the clip release and wiring identification process. Also, make sure you thoroughly vacuum out your unit while it is disassembled. Good luck!!! Read less"

Turns out the threaded hole in the housing was stripped, due I guess to years of vibration. It was too tight to get a tap and dye in there so I drilled the hole out and replaced the screw with a bolt and nut and lock washer. Before drilling it out I tried a few strands of wire and JB Weld, like the trick with stripped wood holes where you break off toothpicks in the hole and fill with wood glue. But that stripped out too so I drilled and used the bolt. Turned out I didn't need that $7 screw. Probably should have known comparing it to the old one which looked the same after I cleaned it. Anyway, it sounds fine again. Read less"

I think my front tumbler bearings are worn down based on the symptoms and sounds Im experiencing but Im not sure. Does this sound about right? If that is the case do I need this part to fix it? Is this a normal thing for driers to do or is there something wrong with mine? Thanks in advanced!",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Trey, it sounds like you need to replace your front tumbler bearings 306508. Do not panic as this is normal wear and tear for your dryer to experience. Also, the heavier loads you put in your washer, the more wear the tumbler bearings will have. I hope this helps."

        "customerQuestion": "Hi, i'm having problems with my dryer. It seems to be snagging the clothes. They come out of the dryer with small snags. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jason,\n\nThank you for your inquiry.  There are three parts that may fix the issue.  The front and rear seal, the dryer drum glides and the drum support rollers.  \n\nFront and Rear Seal \nA worn, torn, or missing front or rear seal could be the reason your clothes are coming out of the dryer torn. The seal is designed to keep clothes from getting between the drum and the front or rear wall of the dryer. If this seal becomes worn or torn, your clothing may become lodged between the two parts. Because the dryer drum keeps turning, the clothes get ripped. Before you can examine and replace a dryer drum's seals, you have to remove the drum. \n\nDryer Drum Glides \nTorn clothing could mean that the glides in your dryer have become defective. The glides support the drum towards the front of the dryer. They can wear over time, causing the drum to slump or sag toward the front of the dryer. When this happens, a pinch point is created at the top of the drum. It is this pinch point that can tear clothing. If this happens in your dryer, you will have to open it up and replace the entire set of glides.\n\nDrum Support Rollers \nAnother possibility for torn clothing could be defective drum support rollers. The rollers support the drum in the back of the dryer. These too can wear over time, causing the drum to slump or sag in the back. Again, a pinch point is created, causing clothing to tear. If it is the drum support rollers in your dryer that have become defective, you will have to replace the entire set of rollers. You will have to open up your dryer's cabinet and remove the drum before you can replace your drum support rollers. \n\nI hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Ralph, Thank you for your inquiry. Usually they do not, so we would recommend checking the drum rollers, the roller shaft/axle, the idler pulley, the drive belt, the drive motor and the felt seal. Hope this helps!"

Before ordering this assembly, we suggest checking your rollers to see if they have excessive visible wear to the point that they look damaged. If that is the case you should replace them.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Kathleen,\nThank you for your question.  If one of the baffles in your dryer is broken, you will need to replace it.  Sometimes while the clothes are drying, the clothes may become caught on the baffle and as the clothes are heating, the area of the clothing where it is hooked on to the baffle can become black with scorch marks.

If the refrigerator is locked, there should be green light lit just above the button.  If the controls are locked press and hold the Lock/Unlock button for three seconds until the green light turns off.  If the temperature alarm light is flashing, press and hold the Temp Alarm button for 3 seconds to turn it off. If this is not the issue, you may need to check the connections between the touchpad and the electronic control board.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "I replaced the upper drum glide on my dryer as one of the plastic tabs had come off the old glide (i.E., this was the third glide i've done in 15 years so not new to the process). Now however, the drum has a random shudder noise like the drum is dragging or not moving smoothly over the new drum glide plastic tabs. I thought the lower felt was only for heat retention, but is this noise a symptom of the lower felt needing replacement also or is the beginning of the rear bearing support going bad?",

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Della, thank you for reaching out. The dryer drum felt seal with adhesive, part number PS970088, is located at the front and rear sides of the drum. You need to remove the top panel and front panel to locate it. We hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

        "repairInstruction": "I first watched the video and disassembled the dryer to see if I could determine what part was squeaking. All looked good except the wheel on the Idler lever which was tight. I vacuumed up the years of lint and reassembled the dryer and waited for the parts to arrive. I ordered the idler lever and also the 2 drum support wheels, belt and 2 drum guides since I thought that is was a good idea to go ahead and replace these parts once I had the dryer disassembled again. Good choice on the belt as once I removed the old belt there was a crack on the underside of the belt. I bought snap ring pliers at home depot but the tips were too big to fit the holes on the snap rings on the drum rollers. I bought another snap ring plier set from an automotive store that came wth 5 snap ring attachments - but again all were too large to fit the snap rings on the drum support rollers. I used a nail and small screwdriver to expand and pull off the snap rings but this approach was frustrating and time consuming. Not sure where to get snap ring pliers that are small enough to fit the holes on the snap rings - so hope that you have better luck locating a set thats small enough! I was able to return the pliers that I purchased - so all good. I was surprised at how easy the dryer came apart and how easy it was easy to work on. When disassembling the dryer - we took pictures of the wire connections before we disconnected them, however at one point we tilted the dryer back to clean behind it and the top slipped a little away from the side panel of the dryer and one of the wires that was connect to the wire block that is up by where the power cord connects cam loose - and it took some time to find and figure out a wiring diagram for this connection. Suggest that you take a pictire of this wire connection block once you lift the lid - just in case a slip occurs and a wire may disconnect. When replacing the idler lever - have a little grease available when you install the new idler lever (between the arm and the bolt area as it constantly moves and the old brease has probably worn away) . After making these repairs I dont think I will ever buy a new dryer as any part , including the heater and motor would be easy to replace and cheaper than a new dryer. Read less"

The thing to do is watch the videos provided by PartsSelect AND go to Youtube and watch a couple of others. Once you see several guys do the job and look over your own machine, it all becomes obvious. Some tips: Work cleanly, you will be dealing with dryer dust and shredded gasket material. Use a vacuum and put down newspaper or a drop cloth. While you have it apart, clean the inside of the machine, and check the other moving parts (eg, rear bearing and drive belt). The glue for the rear drum seal is runny and dries fast so work reasonably quickly. I held the seal on with clothes pins and binder clips and glued about a foot of seal at a time. Everything else goes on easily. They dryer is like a new machine-good for another 30 years. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Dryer drum stopped spinning due to broken belt.",
        "repairInstruction": "Step 1: Unplug the unit, then remove the lint screen and then remove the two screws beneath the lint screen cover. Step 2: At the rear of the dryer there is a small protective metal panel near the upper part of the dryer - remove this first; then at the front of the unit, insert a plastic pry tool between the front edge of the top and the front panel of the dryer and gently pry the top loose. Step 3: Lift the dryer top up and either remove it entirely or let it rest on the back edge and a wall for support. Step 4: On the inside of each side panel near the top front, locate the two screws holding the sides of the dryer to the front panel and remove them. Step 5: Carefully slide the front panel up so that the panel detaches from two metal clips holding the front panel onto the side panels. The drum will likely drop down slightly at this point since it is no longer being supported at the front. Step 6: On the front panel there is a wire that connects the front panel door switch. I left that intact because it was too difficult to remove without risk of breaking it and instead simply set the front panel to the side of the dryer - but if possible remove disconnect the wire and then set the front panel aside. Step 7: Remove the drum by pulling it out, inspect the back felt seal for wear and also the plastic split ring bearings at the front end. When you remove the drum belt the tensioner pulley underneath the drum will likely fall over, but this is to be expected because without the belt and drum providing tension, the piece only fits loosely in a slot at the bottom of the dryer. Step 8: Inspect the drum rollers, motor, and other parts for wear, then vacuum out the inevitable lint and dust inside the unit. Step 9: At this point I also decided to inspect and clean out the lint chute at the back of the unit, so I removed the protective back cover and removed the screws holding the lint chute in place. I then cleaned out the lint that builds up over time inside the chute and checked the two foam lint chute seals at the back of the unit - these needed replacing so I removed the old deteriorated foam and vacuumed off the back of the unit and then adhered the new seals to the back of the dryer. Step 10: Take the new multi-rib belt and drape it around the drum with the ribbed side against the drum - you will likely see a mark around the drum where the old belt was positioned, so use that as a guide. Step 11: Since one of the split ring bearings on my unit was worn, I replaced both at this time by simply pressing the plastic tabs out of the slots at the front of the drum, removed each half of the ring, and reinstalled the new parts - they only correctly fit one way so that the plastic edge lines up cleanly with the front edge of the drum. Step 12: With the felt drum seal toward the back replace the drum - I used a small box to support the drum upon while I reinstalled the drum - this will make it much easier to manipulate the belt around the tensioner and motor. At this point I reached underneath the drum and reinstalled the tensioner. by positioning it in the two small slots near at the bottom panel that are near the front of the dryer motor. Then take the belt and pull it through the tensioner and around the motor pulley at the front of the unit. You will likely have to push up slightly on the drum and tensioner to allow the belt to be pulled through the tensioner and around the motor pulley. Step 13: Rotate the drum slowly by hand at least one full revolution and check to see that the felt seal at the back is not pinched and that the belt does not fall off the pulley. Step 14: I removed the box supporting the bottom of the drum, then took the front panel and fit the front of the drum against it so that the split ring bearing matched up to the front panel. Step 15: The drum will still be somewhat loose and that allowed me to carefully lift the front panel up and then slide it down back onto the two metal clips that hold the front panel to the side panels. Step 16: Reinstall the two screws that also hold the front panel to the side panels. And if you also removed the wire connection to the dryer door, reattach that too. Step 17: If you removed the lint chute, reinstall it from the back while the lid is still off so that it is easier to slide it into position. Step 18: Reattach the top of the unit by seating it against the top of the frame (of course if you disconnected wires, reattach those too) and reinstalling the two screws underneath the lint screen cover. Step 19: Reattach the rear panel cover and small protective metal panel. Step 20: Reattach the flex-hose to the lint exhaust. Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer develops a loud thumping noise as it heats up. After 10 minutes it is thumping at its loudest  im sure this is a heat related problem because it doesn't thump if i run it on fluff which uses no heat  this problem started after i replaced the top front bearing because the slides were worn off and the drum had started wearing into the bearing itself. I even put a new motor in it. The original problem was the dryer stop tumbling  during heat cycles after about ten minutes(about the same time the thumping is at its worst) but it wasnt thumping originally  i created that problem somehow after i replaced the bearing.  It will automatically start tumbling and drying again after it cools down after about 5 minutes. This process goes on and on until it finally has the clothes dry after about a hour or so. My question is. What could i have done replacing the bearing that would make it thump during heatup(by the way i replaced the long felt peice too that goes around the bottom piece of the bearing. And 2nd im guessing that one of the 3 thermostats is faulty and thats why its kicking off when hot(never kicks off during non-heat fluff cycles)  my understanding is that the thermisters only control turning the heat elements on and off.(is that correct?) so thermisters wont turn dryer off they will just cause heating problems when failing. I need advice on what parts i need advice on what i did to create this thumping noise.  Thank you very much.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Garry, thank you for your question. In regards to the bearing; It sounds like the thumping might be a result of the bearing at the back of the drum. I would check the rear bearing part number WE25M40 to see if the part is bad. In regards to the temperature problem; I would check the safety thermostat part number WE4M160 which is located on the heating element. This thermostat acts as a safety mechanism that keeps the dryer from overheating. Once the dryer temperature reaches a certain point, this piece will shut down power to the heating element. If the unit isn't cycling properly this might be the cause. While you in there testing that thermostat you might want to test the other ones that are located on the heating element as well. I hope this helps!"

The tools needed for this installation project are: 1/4 inch nut driver, Phillips screwdriver, small flat blade screwdriver, and putty knife. Remember to unplug your dryer from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for installation instructions.

        "storyTitle": "The dryer belt broke. During the effort to replace the belt it was noted that the lint trap housing seals were in need of replacement.",
        "repairInstruction": "With the dryer taken apart to replace the broken belt it was obvious that the lint seals had not been working properly due to the excessive amount of lint covering all of the inside surfaces of the dryer. The belt idler pully had also moved from its normal mounting position and was laying at the bottom of the dryer. Because the lint had c overed the bottom before the belt broke it was obvious to determine where the idler pully attached to the bottom.Before cleaning I marked the exact location where the idler pully mounted to the bottom of the dryer.While waiting for the replacement parts to be delivered a vacuum cleaner was used to remove lint from the inside surfaces of the dryer as well as the old fragments of the lint trap housing seals were removed and surfaces where the new seals would attach were cleaned.Assembling the dryer with the new belt was a challenge due to the lack of support for the drum while getting the new belt in place, lined up properly, threaded through the idler pully and attached to the motor drive shaft. This is how I installed the new belt:I used a piece of wood wider than the sides of the dryer, drilled holes that allowed for a piece of cloths line rope to be looped through and used to support the door opening end of the drum. The drum was set on the seal and rollers at the back of the dryer.The temporary wood /rope hanger was placed at the front end of the dryer resting on the sides with the top of the dryer raised. The rope was adjusted until the drum rested on the back rollers and the rope like it would be positioned normally.The new belt was then gently installed under the temporary support rope and around the drum.The new belt had many kinks from shipping and was difficult to align with the location on the drum where it needs to ride so small strips of tape were temporarily used to hold the new belt in position until it could be fed through the idler pully and on to the drive shaft.Several small pieces of a cardboard box were used to shim under the idler pully to hold it in its proper location as well as to make the belt attachment to the drive shaft easier.With the belt attached, the temporary cardboard shims were removed from under the idler pully.The front of the dryer was attached .The temporary board and rope hanger was removed.The tape that had been placed over the new belt to hold it in proper alignment was removed as the drum was rotated slowly by hand to ensure that all tape was removed prior to closing the top of the dryer.The seals as well as the remainder of the dryer assembly was completed without any problems.The dryer ran well for its initial trial spin and has dried several loads of laundry since.Great parts and support Thankyou Read less"

That bad. Because there wasn't much support there is a small tear in the metal on the back drum. The felt seal for the drum had basically been worn down to pieces. So I order tw o drum support rollers, two roller shafts, a new drum felt seal, and a new rib belt.After the repair, no more squeaking, literally a huge difference, and because of there's plenty of support now for the drum, there isn't any clothes being torn. If it weren't for the videos and the parts, we would of spent hundreds of dollars on a new dryer. Instead we spent just over $100 and now our dryer is quiet and operating better than when we got it.

Take drum su pport by removing the screws and then remove the belt from the motor and remove the drum. The hardest part was removing the C clips from the roller axle even with the snap ring pliers. Replace the drum rollers and reverse the process to re-assemble. Of course, the rollers weren't the problem even though they were worn out from 20 years of service. I ended up replacing the idler pully and and the idler pully support arm. If I had all of the parts prior to starting, the total time would have been about an hour.

Once I received the parts, I followed the great how-to videos by Steve to disassemble the front of the dryer and remove the drum. I could not get to the repairs right away since the interior of the dryer was quite dirty and I took a lot of time to clean it out. Once I got to removing and replacing the drum rollers, idler pulley, rear drum felt shaft, and drum belt, everything went smoothly and was just as easy as Steve described in the videos. If I didn't have such a dirty machine interior, removing the old parts and installing the new parts would have taken less than an hour. I had to hold off on installing the front glide kit and front drum felt seal since I forgot to order two of each (I'll install these at a later date.

I used a combination of ne edle nose pliers and a hex screw bit to loose hared to reach hex screws. For the felt seal on the front panel, I used a flathead screwdriver to remove the old seal and replace the new seal. The most tricky thing was making sure the seal was laying right along the drum when putting the front panel back on. Once back together, the skidding sound disappeared. Replacing the blower wheel is pretty easy once I got past the difficult screws holding the cover down. I used snap ring pliers to remove the snap ring then put the new blower wheel on and put it all back together. I found that the tip diameter of the snap ring pliers needed to be less than 0.05'' to fit into the snap ring holes of both the snap rings for the roller wheels and the blower wheel. Read less"

My dryer stopped heating up. I first started with cleaning and replacing exhaust system. That didnât correct the problem, so I went to the thermal fuse, which was easy to change but still wasnâ t the problem. I then removed the drum to get at the heating element. When I removed the drum I found out that all the felt seals were falling apart. I didnât think that was the problem but figured I might as well change them while I was in there. I ordered the seals and the heating element. Removing and replacing the heating element was very easy. Removing the old felt seals was a little harder. My dryer does not have the clips, it was glued on. It took some time to remove most of the glue and install the new seals. After putting it all back together it worked great.

        "customerQuestion": "In addition to the marks on my clothes, i'm also getting small holes in my clothes. Went to take out clothes and the waistband of a pair of jeans was stuck at the rear of the drum in between two pieces of the metal. Could it also be something else that has to be replaced along with the felt?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Gina,\nThank you for your question.  If the dryer is leaving holes in your clothing, there are a few parts that you will need to check.  A worn, torn, or missing front or rear seal could be the reason your clothes are coming out of the dryer torn. The seal is designed to keep clothes from getting between the drum and the front or rear wall of the dryer. If this seal becomes worn or torn, your clothing may become lodged between the two parts. Because the dryer drum keeps turning, the clothes get ripped. Before you can examine and replace a dryer drum's seals, you have to remove the drum.  Dryer Drum Glides\nTorn clothing could mean that the glides in your dryer have become defective. The glides support the drum towards the front of the dryer. They can wear over time, causing the drum to slump or sag toward the front of the dryer. When this happens, a pinch point is created at the top of the drum. It is this pinch point that can tear clothing. If this happens in your dryer, you will have to open it up and replace the entire set of glides.  Another possibility for torn clothing could be defective drum support rollers. The rollers support the drum in the back of the dryer. These too can wear over time, causing the drum to slump or sag in the back. Again, a pinch point is created, causing clothing to tear. If it is the drum support rollers in your dryer that have become defective, you will have to replace the entire set of rollers. You will have to open up your dryer's cabinet and remove the drum before you can replace your drum support rollers.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "I submitted a question 11 days ago.  I replaced the drum rollers and axles, a new belt, a new blower, new front tumbler glides (pads/bearings), and I put in a new heating element.  Then I got a slight rubbing/faint scraping sound from the front. I then did replace both front and rear felt seals as suggested and still got the noise.  Finally, I remembered reading somewhere, but not in the Maytag dryer service manual which I got online that the drum rollers could be misaligned, but I wondered how could they be; they just fit right in on the axles.  Well, each axle is held in with a nut and by loosening it, I found there was a little play, probably not more than 1/16 of an inch, so I moved the axles to the right and up, which allowed the rotating drum to move over slightly to the right and slightly up.  The gap between the rotating and stationary drum was too close on one side causing the scrapping noise.  This is valuable information for other DIY people, so I hope you'll publish it!",

If i open the dryer door and press the button at the top that keeps the dryer on, turn the dryer on, and then take my hand by the lint filter and pull the bulkhead piece forward, the rubbing/scraping sound stops.  The felt seems to be o.K.  Not sure if i should replaced the felt and run the dryer to see if it gets better.  It also seems that if i take the front panel off and leave the bulkhead on and turn the dryer on this way, i don't get a rubbing/scaping sound.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Robert, thank you for inquiring. This Front or Rear Drum Felt Seal part PS11740771 for your model may fix the issue. You may also want to consider either the Spring Retaining Clip part PS11739294 or the Drive Motor part PS3500893.

Next, remove the lint screen and two screws holding the lint screen housing to the lid. Remove the two side moldings on the control panel and the two screws holding doun the enclosure. Slide the control enclosure forward and lift up . Ta ke a picture of the wiring for later reference and carefully unplug the wires and set the enclosure aside. Next, remove the two screws holding the rear lid retaining clips. Gently pry up on the front of the lid to realese hold doun clips, swing the lid up and remove it from the rear clips, set the lid aside. Remove the two screws on corners of front cover located near the top, unplug the door switch. Remove the front cover by lifting straight up, set aside. Now remove the belt from the motor by realeasing the tensioner and remove it from the drum. You can now remove the drum through the front. Now is a good time to check the condition of your drum rollers, clean them as needed or replace them. Clean the roller shafts and apply a quality grease. \"Clean the roller groove on the drum\" this is what makes the drum sound bumpy! Remove the rear seal and replace it as per the instructions that come with the seal. The glue dries quickly, so have the seal fully in place and apply glue to small areas replacing the seal fully before moving on. You can now reinstall the drum being careful not to damage the seal. Place the drum on the rollers, reach inside and work the seal into place. You can now replace the belt and work in reverse with the casings!

We had a hard time trying to keep the rear seal on so used CLOTHES PINS to put on the seal, then we added the adhesive repla cing the clothes pins until the whole seal glued. Since the drum was already out, we put it in the sun to really dry the glue.Next we attacked the drum support rollers. We removed the back of the dryer and used a 9/16\" socket with an extention to remove the back nuts.We took out the shaft, used sandpaper on it and then replaced the triangle clips and the support rollers.Then put the back on again, then the front, makingsure the drum fit on the front. You have to then figure out the belt, with the rubber side down, and then work with the tensioner, which took my poor husband a while. Then lowered the top, put the clips back on and the bottom, making sure we turned the drum. It was a success after about 3 hours. You can do it a lot easier with pictures. Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "Would replacing this part fix the problem of pieces of clothes being stuck between drum and frame causing what appears to b great stains? Thank you",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ronald,\nThank you for your question.  There are three parts that may be causing this issue.  A worn, torn, or missing front or rear seal could be the reason your clothes are coming out of the dryer torn. The seal is designed to keep clothes from getting between the drum and the front or rear wall of the dryer. If this seal becomes worn or torn, your clothing may become lodged between the two parts. Because the dryer drum keeps turning, the clothes get ripped. Before you can examine and replace a dryer drum's seals, you have to remove the drum.  Torn clothing could mean that the glides in your dryer have become defective. The glides support the drum towards the front of the dryer. They can wear over time, causing the drum to slump or sag toward the front of the dryer. When this happens, a pinch point is created at the top of the drum. It is this pinch point that can tear clothing. If this happens in your dryer, you will have to open it up and replace the entire set of glides.  Another possiblity for torn clothing could be defective drum support rollers. The rollers support the drum in the back of the dryer. These too can wear over time, causing the drum to slump or sag in the back. Again, a pinch point is created, causing clothing to tear. If it is the drum support rollers in your dryer that have become defective, you will have to replace the entire set of rollers. You will have to open up your dryer's cainet and remove the drum before you can replace your drum support rollers.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

I timed each presentation---five minut es for one, less than ten for the other. I watched the videos several times and took notes, so I would have the procedures in front of me while working on the unit at the other end of the house, I'm 77, forgetful. When I disassembled my unit, I noticed several rusted areas, so decided not to complete the project until I could get to the store for paint. As a primary care-giver for a severely dementiated 79-year Old Lady, I have to arrange for a relief to go shopping. That's why the machine is still in pieces. Got the paint, though, so back to work---eventually. When I disassembled the dryer, tucked away in the bottom was a very informative TECH SHEET, the discovery of which ticked me off that it wasn't provided with the owner's manual. At the bottom it says, \"For Service Technicians' Use Only.\" In my house, I'm the \"...Service Technician...,\" chief cook and bottle washer, launderer and litter box attendant. Read less"

After getting rid of the rat and decomposition, we sanitized the entire housing with soap & chlorine bleach. Reassembly was uneventful and relatively easy.

The \"Check lint screen\" light is just a reminder to check and clean the lint screen before or after each load. There is no sensor that will detect if it's clean. The Check lint screen should turn off as soon as the dryer is started. You can try to check the wire harness between the console and the electronic control board. The control board might need to be replaced if the light will not go off. Hope this helps!"

        "repairInstruction": "In my case, it was the solenoids. Take off the top be removing two screws on back, then slide the top back and off. Then remove little screws on top that hold the plastic bar with the electronic controls. This very easily will pop up, donât unplug it, just lay it aside on top of machine. Under this you can see the white metal piece that contains the door. This whole piece comes off with the door in place. Look for four screws across the top, remove em. Then open the door, there are two facing out about 10 inches apart. Remove em. Now slide whole door out (sort of a hinge on the bottom) from the top. After it pops out from the tops, lean it out about 1 foot then pull up hard. It comes off at the bottom. Gently unplug the door, you will see the wire to unplug. I used a small screwdriver to gently pry the plug apart to get it started. After the front panel is removed, you can see the gas valve lower right. On top of the gas valve which is about 5 inches by 5 inches, you will two black cylinders on top of it. Cylinders that are 1.5 inches tall and about 1 inch wide. These are your solenoids. These create an electromagnetic field that opens the gas valve. There is a silver colored piece of metal on top of them holding them in place with two screws on top. Take this cover off the two black solenoids (Black cylinders). Then remove the cylinders after gently unplugging them. Do not just pull on the wires. Use an ohm meter to test the old ones after you slide them up and off what looks like a silver post. There are two metal tabs on one where the plug plugs onto it. Set your ohm meter for 1000 and touch the two metal tabs. Your meter should say there IS a circuit. If your meter says there is no circuit your solenoid is bad. The other solenoid has threee tabs. Hold your solenoid with the metal plugs down and the cylinder is standing upright. Have the three prongs facing you. The prong on the left as you face the solenoid it is your common. Touch this prong and then with the other wire touch the middle prong. You need to see a circuit that is closed, or connected. If there is no circuit your solenoid is bad. Now touch your two testing wires on the two outside prongs. You still need to see a circuit. If no circuit you have bad solenoid. Replace em. The solenoids die slowly over years. Your dryer will start to take longer to dry. This is sign of dying solenoids. To the left of the gas valve you can see the sensors that determine if the air coming out of the dryer is damp or dry. Replace them at the same time. Where you are the burner, on the left of the 5 inch wide tube it is in you will see a sensor, rectangle shape 2 inch by 1 inch. This determines if the lighter is glowing. Replace it at this same time. On top of the burner tube, top right, hard to reach, there is another sensor that shuts it all down if it is over heating. There are two wires plugged into it. Use a MAGNETIC and very short philips head to remove it. Slowly, donât drop the screws. Pull the whole sensor out while plugged in, then unplug it using a screw driver to help get it started unplugging. When the new sensor goes in, screw it on place first. Do not try to screw the new one in with wires on it. It is not easy, but you can do it. Use a small flash light etc to help see. Once screwed on, plug in your wires. It does not matter which wire goes on which end. So after you replace all your sensors (4 total) and you replaced those two round black solenoids, you can put it all back together.Do not buy cheap piece of sh-t parts. The cheap ones are made in China with short cuts, low quality metal and ceramics. Cheap. Use authentic Maytag parts, each sensor should be like $30. I replaced all of mine for $180. I now have a brand new unit as far as the electronics are concerned, good for another 10 years. Read less"

First you will have to disconnect the power to your appliance and then remove the sensor. Second you will set your multi-meter to the lowest setting and then calibrate it to show zero. Take each probe of your meter and touch one to each of the prongs on your sensor. If the meter continues to show zero or infinite ohms, your sensor is bad and needs to be replaced.

Thank you again...",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jeff, thank you for your question. Unfortunately no. However you would test all of those parts with a multi meter. Your radiant flame sensor, thermostats, and thermal fuses should be testing 0 ohms to be working. Your igniter should read between 50 - 400 ohms. Your heating element should read between 0 - 50 ohms. You will need to remove all of those parts before testing to have accurate results. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Coils react differently to these. Do the numbers you use apply to both digital and analog meters? I figure the ignitor and sensors do not have this (possible) issue. Tyia",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi John,\nThank you for your question.  To test a radiant flame sensor, Set a multimeter to the lowest ohms of resistance setting. The sign for ohms looks like a horseshoe, and depending on your model, this setting could be RX1, 200, 2K, or X10. Touch the probes together on an analog meter and rotate the dial on the side of the meter until the needle rest at zero on the far right of the display.  Pull the wire connectors off the flame sensor terminals. Touch one multimeter probe to one of the flame sensor terminals and touch the remaining terminal with the remaining probe. If the needle sweeps to the right and rest at zero on the analog meter, or it the digital meter displays zeros, the flame sensor is good. If your meter displays any other reading, the sensor is bad and must be replaced. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

You can use a multi meter. I would say first test your M series coils, then your thermostats, and then your igniter, and radiant flame sensor. Those are the most common parts to go out. All of them should read 0 ohms when testing them. The igniter however should test anywhere between 50 and 400 ohms of resistance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If your fuse is out then your machine will not heat. If your thermostats are not working right they could be reading the wrong temperature and shutting down the machine because it thinks that it is getting too hot. Good luck with your repair."

        "repairInstruction": "Called LG on the phone and they gave the button presses for diagnostics, which then gave the HST code, saying the Humidity sensor was bad.The part was described as the Humidity sensor module. Actually it's just the wire leads for the sensor which must be electronic and only accessible by disassembling the dryer. There were descr iptions about cleaning the wires, perhaps because some people use dryer sheets which cause a buildup on the wires and prevent them from doing their job. I use wool balls and have no buildup on my wires and replacing them did not fix the sensor, because the module accessible inside the dryer is not the moisture sensor, but only the wire leads.

        "repairInstruction": "Despite the young age of this dryer, and failure of all the other trials to fix the problem, I figured maybe the igniter is the problem. Ordered one. Followed a U tube video to take the unit apart. Noticed immediately that there was lots of lint pretty much everywhere inside the cabinet. Come to find that the blower and the vent had never been connected, with about two inches gap. So, some of the exhaust was going out the vent hose, but lots was not. In fact, lint had coated the propane jet and the air mixer assembly. Replacing the igniter was not particularly difficult, once the dryer was in lots of pieces. I did not test the igniter before replacing it. I did connect the vent outlet to the blower and secured it. End result was a perfectly functioning unit and a happy wife. I don't recall reading about this as a possible cause of propane odor and failure of the unit to heat up. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "Following the reference video, step by step and taking progress photos along the way, organizing screws and hardware as they were removed.The discrepancy I found was the new rollers that I received were complete with the shaft. The video with the older rollers instruct removing the rollers from the shaft. To use th e new rollers with the new shaft, requires removing an additional panel at both the front 2 and also the full back panel for the rear 2, to get a wrench on both ends of the shaft, and then attach the new roller bearing shaft assembly and re-install the panel.Other than that, it went very smoothly and the result was a quiet rotating drum. No more thumping!My dryer actually required 2 moisture sensors, but had only ordered one pack, which only came with 1 sensor. For whatever reason, I thought the pack would have had the 2 pieces. Another reviewer made note to wear work gloves as some of the hardwares metal edges are quite sharp. Following that advice I completed the repair in 3 hours without a scratch.

Just so replace beings I was in there. Repl acing the parts was easy, found them just by looking for matches to the new parts. Reassembled the dryer, dont think I put a single screw back where I got it lol. And still haven't put the top lid back on due to difficulty. Not sure if I even needed any parts, found a nest in my outside vent completely plugging it. But after a good cleaning and replacing the parts the dryer dries the best it has since we've owned it.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Dave, \n\nThank you for your question. So you have multiple thermostats and thermal fuses in your appliance. I would suggest testing all of those parts with a multi meter to see if they are working correctly. You can test them all with a multi meter, they should all read close to 0 ohms to be working correctly. You may also want to test your heating element itself as well. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer cooling light always on and have no heating at all",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Ken,\nThank you for your question.  If the light is always on and there is no heat, then you may have an issue with the moisture sensing circuit.  If this is the issue, you will need to test the dryer to see if it will heat and work properly in a time dry cycle.  If the dryer is working properly, then you will need to check the sensor bars to see if there is any lint on them.  If there is lint on them they will not detect any moisture.  The bars are located on the lint screen.  If they are clean, then you will need to check the control board and the wiring connected to it.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Gary,\nThank you for your question.  If your dryer is shutting down too soon, the sensor does fix the issue the majority of the time.  There are some other parts that you will need to check as well.  You will need to check the thermostat, the lint filter and thermistor.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Getting code d80 and h5. I cleaned all the air exhaust hose, wall ducts and vent outside. Still getting the code. I take the exhaust hose off the wall ducts and ran a test, the same code come up. When the dry is on the air coming out of the hose wasnât warm, but the dryer is warm. What else can i do? I had a load of clothes in the dryer but they never got dry. What do you recommend?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Jennifer, thank you for your question. The d80 error means the dryer is 80% clogged either in the air exhaust hose, wall ducts, or the vent outside. So if you have checked your entire system and your are still getting that error, you may have to start checking all of your thermostats. The first parts to check in this case would be all of your thermostats and thermal fuses. You can test those parts with a multi meter and they should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. If those parts are fine, you should then go on to testing your heating element as well. You can also test that with a multi meter and it should be reading  between 0 - 50 ohms.I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Check filter sign still on.  Dryer repeatedly shuts off after about 5 minutes of running, but not heat at all during the 5 minutes it runs.Thank you for any guidance.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Susan, thank you for your question. First try unplugging the unit and letting it set for about 5 minutes, then plugging it back in to see if it will reset that light. We would recommend testing the thermostats in the unit, as most heat/non heating issues are cause by one or more thermostats. Here is some information on testing them.  Set your multimeter to the R X 1 setting. Take each of your meter's probes and touch one to each terminal. You are testing for continuity, and you should receive a reading of either zero or infinity. At room temperature, testing the thermostat should produce a reading of zero. But if a thermostat is tested when it is heated to its limit, a reading of infinity should be produced. We strongly recommend that you test your thermostat at room temperature. If the test you conduct with your thermostat does not produce these results, then you should replace the component. If the thermostats are fine, check the moisture sensors to be sure they are not corroded or rusted and if they are replace them. I hope this helps!"

We would recommend replacing the bars to see if this will fix the issue, as cleaning them before, fixed the issue. We would recommend replacing both of them in the unit. If the issue persists, we would recommend testing the thermostats and the thermistor. I hope this helps!"

Our dryer is stopping during its dry cycle and upon further \"inspection\" its not pumping any hot air out and the clothes are still cold. The lint vent is free of clogs. Thanks for the help",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Cameron,\n\nThank you for your question. This part can be tested with a multi-meter. It should ready 50K ohms of resistance at 77 degrees F. However, this part is not part of the dryer heating circuit, so it is unlikely that this is the cause of your appliance not getting any hot air. Test it anyway, just in case. You should also look at your thermal limiter, high limit thermostat, and your heating element. Good luck with your repair."

This part controls the temperature of the inside of the dryer drum and prevents the dryer from overheating. If the thermistor is malfunctioning it will shut the unit off when it gets too hot. You should also check PartSelect Number: PS446428 which is the high limit thermostat,. This part turns the element on and off to maintain the right internal temperature. I hope this helps!"

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Pedro, thank you for writing. The error code E4A indicates that the dryer ran too long. This could be due to a ventilation restriction. Check the ventilation to make sure that it is clear, and also the Blower Wheel for heavy lint build up. You may also want to consider either the Control Thermistor part PS1149368 or the Door Catch part PS418433 for your model. We hope this helps."

The only cycle it completes is the timed dry cycle which is 15 minutes. When it stops , all the light flash under the cycle status tab. Drying , cool down , and extended tumble. What part failure would cause this ? Thank you for your help in advance",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Chris,\nThank you for your question.  If the dryer is shutting off too soon, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the high limit thermostat, the control thermistor, the thermal fuse and the door catch.  For the electronic parts, you will need to test the parts with a multi-meter.  Here is a link to one of our videos on YouTube that you may use as a general reference on how to use one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWC44fHn0As.  For the high limit thermostat, place the multi-meter on the Rx1 setting and test for continuity by touching the probes to each terminal. You should receive a reading of zero or infinity. If your test does not produce either of those readings, you need a replacement high limit thermostat.  For the thermal fuse, make sure your multi-meter is also set to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals with the probes to test for continuity. If you receive a reading other than zero or infinity, there is no continuity and you need a replacement thermal fuse. The multi-meter reading for the thermistor should read 50000 ohms of resistance at 77Â°F. You will need to inspect the parts visually to verify if it is damaged.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

        "repairInstruction": "Fixed it eventually with part PS470049 ('M' Series Ignition Coil Kit). See separate story.The flame sensor did not fix it but read on for info on how to replace this part. Before replacing this part, I should have read another posting in a different web site about the ignition coils: if you see a red glow inside the burner uni t but the flame does not come on, then the problem is likely to be with the coils, not the flame sensor. However since some users here had solved the problem by replacing the flame sensors, I figured I'd try it. The setting for \"More dry, less dry\" never worked either so maybe this would fix two problems at once. This dryer is a stacked front loader sitting on top of our washing machine. Opening the little front door (lower left side) is easy once you figure out that a little screw below needs to be removed. I almost broke the door trying to pull it open. The sensor is attached to the side of the flame area cylinder. It was hard to remove both the screw and the part itself from the slots as it's very springy. In fact when I finally removed it, it dropped to the base of the unit and sparks went flying as one of the electrical clips touched the metal (ground). Tip: first disconnect the electrical lead coming from the back of the unit to the ingnition block and later I used rubber gloves just in case. (I could not access the plug/outlet in the back). I installed the new part easily, though I was confused by the electrical leads: the white wire connects to the lead that has a red plastic dot on the side, but I think that must be a mechanical part and not a (wrong) marking, while the red connects to the other lead. Anyway, I connected it the same way I found it and put it back. Reconnected the other electrical wires and closed the door.This did not fix the problem which turned out to be with the gas valve coils: as they get old, they turn off the flame when they get hot, even though the dryer keeps on turning. To read how to replace that part, search for comments under part number PS470049 ('M' Series Ignition Coil Kit). I don't know whether replacing the flame sensor is going to fix the \"more dry-less dry\" function, will have to see. Still, this website is great. Our dryer is a Westinghouse bought in 1991 (almost 20 years old!) and with this fixes it's just like new. Read less"

To test the igniter and safety thermostat with a multimeter, set the selection to the lowest setting for ohms of resistance. Make sure the meter is calibrated. For the ignitor touch the probes to the terminals, the meter reading for continuity should be between 50 and 400 ohms of resistance. For the safety thermostat, it should be tested at room temperature and you should touch the probes to the outer terminals. The reading should be around 0 ohms of resistance. Hope this helps!"

        "repairInstruction": "In my case, it was the solenoids. Take off the top be removing two screws on back, then slide the top back and off. Then remove little screws on top that hold the plastic bar with the electronic controls. This very easily will pop up, donât unplug it, just lay it aside on top of machine. Under this you can see the white metal piece that contains the door. This whole piece comes off with the door in place. Look for four screws across the top, remove em. Then open the door, there are two facing out about 10 inches apart. Remove em. Now slide whole door out (sort of a hinge on the bottom) from the top. After it pops out from the tops, lean it out about 1 foot then pull up hard. It comes off at the bottom. Gently unplug the door, you will see the wire to unplug. I used a small screwdriver to gently pry the plug apart to get it started. After the front panel is removed, you can see the gas valve lower right. On top of the gas valve which is about 5 inches by 5 inches, you will two black cylinders on top of it. Cylinders that are 1.5 inches tall and about 1 inch wide. These are your solenoids. These create an electromagnetic field that opens the gas valve. There is a silver colored piece of metal on top of them holding them in place with two screws on top. Take this cover off the two black solenoids (Black cylinders). Then remove the cylinders after gently unplugging them. Do not just pull on the wires. Use an ohm meter to test the old ones after you slide them up and off what looks like a silver post. There are two metal tabs on one where the plug plugs onto it. Set your ohm meter for 1000 and touch the two metal tabs. Your meter should say there IS a circuit. If your meter says there is no circuit your solenoid is bad. The other solenoid has threee tabs. Hold your solenoid with the metal plugs down and the cylinder is standing upright. Have the three prongs facing you. The prong on the left as you face the solenoid it is your common. Touch this prong and then with the other wire touch the middle prong. You need to see a circuit that is closed, or connected. If there is no circuit your solenoid is bad. Now touch your two testing wires on the two outside prongs. You still need to see a circuit. If no circuit you have bad solenoid. Replace em. The solenoids die slowly over years. Your dryer will start to take longer to dry. This is sign of dying solenoids. To the left of the gas valve you can see the sensors that determine if the air coming out of the dryer is damp or dry. Replace them at the same time. Where you are the burner, on the left of the 5 inch wide tube it is in you will see a sensor, rectangle shape 2 inch by 1 inch. This determines if the lighter is glowing. Replace it at this same time. On top of the burner tube, top right, hard to reach, there is another sensor that shuts it all down if it is over heating. There are two wires plugged into it. Use a MAGNETIC and very short philips head to remove it. Slowly, donât drop the screws. Pull the whole sensor out while plugged in, then unplug it using a screw driver to help get it started unplugging. When the new sensor goes in, screw it on place first. Do not try to screw the new one in with wires on it. It is not easy, but you can do it. Use a small flash light etc to help see. Once screwed on, plug in your wires. It does not matter which wire goes on which end. So after you replace all your sensors (4 total) and you replaced those two round black solenoids, you can put it all back together.Do not buy cheap piece of sh-t parts. The cheap ones are made in China with short cuts, low quality metal and ceramics. Cheap. Use authentic Maytag parts, each sensor should be like $30. I replaced all of mine for $180. I now have a brand new unit as far as the electronics are concerned, good for another 10 years. Read less"

        "repairInstruction": "The dryer was packed with lint and burnt lint. It was so bad I had to disassemble the entire dryer to fully vacuum it out. Thermostat and thermistor were fairly straight forward. The large wiring harness was difficult. Had to remove the top, control panel, front drum support, blower fan and housing, and finally the rear drum support. I left the old harness on the dryer, and then started around the motor as that was easy to reference in the new wiring harness. I proceeded to remove the old harness, and place the new harness in the retaining clips one clip at a time first moving towards the burner, and then going up the rear of the dryer and finally into the computer board. I had placed groups of screws in very small zip lock bags and labeled them as I took the dryer apart. This helped to remind me where all the screws went when I reassembled. Remember to NOT touch the ignitor with your fingers. Something about the oils on your fingers I was told. Reassemble in reverse order. Rear drum support, motor, gas valve (I had to remove all to clean),Turned the gas on after I reinstalled the gas valve to check for leaks, Drum and belt, attach belt, front drum support, lint trap, front panel/door, and finally the top. Then vent & plug it in and turn it on. Good luck. Read less"

You will need to check the thermistor, the thermostat, the electronic control board, the thermal fuse with bracket, the drive belt and the door switch.  I hope this helps.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Patrick,\nThank you for your question.  If you have replaced the thermistor and you are still getting the TS error code, check both the lint screen and the vent system for obstructions. If they are clogged, you will need to clean them.  This should help resolve the issue.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

If fine, you should then go on to testing your heating element as well. You can also test that with a multi meter and it should be reading between 0 - 50 ohms. Good luck with your repair."

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Eric,\n\nThanks for your question. Number 020 is the yellow catch. Number 022 is the blue catch. Number 025 is the green catch. If the catch you are replacing has an 18 on it or if it is silver, use the 020 yellow catch. If nothing matches check if your dryer has one catch, and make sure it is not a 27\" Wide Laundry Center or a Commercial Stacked Pair and if that is true, use the 020 yellow catch. If it is either of those types of machines, use the 025 green catch. If your dryer has two catches, use the 022 blue catch on the top and the 020 yellow catch on the bottom.\n\nI hope this helps."

Here is what's happening;  when i have the dryer set to start and close the door, the dryer makes a soft whirring/clicking sound.  When i push the start button, there is a loud click, the whirring stops, but the dryer does not start.  Do these symptoms give any indication of which part might be faulty?",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Erin,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a couple of other parts that you would check to see if they are working correctly. The first part I would actually suggest testing is your start switch. You may also want to test your thermal fuse as well. You can test both parts with a multi meter to see what the continuity is on them. If both of those parts are fine you might go on to test your thermostats and your element as well. If those parts are fine then it may be your timer that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

I will order the latch anyway but I am wondering if anything else could be wrong? In addition, the light burned out. Does it require the exact replacement bulb?",

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Morgan, thank you for your question. These would be the instructions from the manufacturer: This kit contains (2) door strikes and various door catches. Some dryers may use more than (1) catch. Note numbers stamped on the catches and/or color of the spring steel, 20 (yellow), 22 (blue) or 25 (green). Match the number and/or color, of the catch being replaced with the catch supplied in the kit. If the catch youâre replacing has an 18 stamped on it or is silver in color, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. The (2) door strikes contained in the kit are the same. Please replace the door strike(s) with the appropriate number of door catches being used for this repair. If you cannot match the number on the catches, match the catch(es) by the following: 1. If your dryer has one catch and is not a 27â Wide Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. If it is a 27â Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 25 (green) for replacement. 2. If your dryer has 2 catches, use the catch stamped with 22 (blue) on the top and the catch stamped 20 (yellow) on the bottom.  I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

        "storyTitle": "Inside oven door glass was broken and door was not closing completely.",
        "repairInstruction": "I removed the door from the oven by locking the hinges with the built-in locks leaving the door open about 20 degrees. the door can then be lifted slightly off the hinges and pulled out at the bottom while tilting the top inward to remove it from the oven. With the door laying on a suitable surface with the outside face down, I removed a bout 6 or 8 screws from the door inside panel freeing the springs and the inside panel from the middle and front panels. Care must be taken to note from which locations the pointed self-taping screws come as opposed to the narrower-thread machine screws that hold the springs. Note: The inside panel does not need to be removed! Once the inside panel is freed from the inner panels, using suction cups the glass can be lifted slightly and slid toward the bottom of the door, rotated slightly, and removed through the window hole in the back face of the door. The new glass is installed in a similar way using suction cups by maneuvering it at a angle through window hole and into its frame. The hinges were replaced by lifting the bottom of the inner door panel slightly to clear the hinge and swapping in the new ones. Be sure to observe the difference between the left and right hinges in the location of the screw hole at the bottom of each hinge The narrow-thread machine screws that hold the hinges to the inside panel should be installed first while you can get you hand inside the door to hold each hinge in alignment with the screw holes while you start each screw. Re-install the pointed self tapping screws by pressing down on the rear panel to collapse the spring-action glass frames within the door so that the short screws will reach their threaded hole. Be careful to back off the self tapping screws first until you feel a click into the original threads to avoid stripping the holes. Last re-install the door on the oven. The replacement hinges should have come with the springs already \"cocked\" with the built in locks in place. Install the door with it in tan almost-closed position by sliding the hinge extensions into the slots in the oven. Once the extensions are properly in the slots the door can be fully opened and the built-in hinge locks re-positioned to the unlocked position to allow the door to fully close. Should you accidentally release only one of the hinge locks in trying to insert the hinge extensions into the slots you will have to reset the hinge. If the door is free from the oven, this may require a pair of heavy pliers, like channel lock pliers, to re-tension the hinge spring and \"cock\" the hinge extension by re-positioning the built-in lock in the locked position. If the hinge lock on one side of the door releases, but the the opposite side hinge extension is not fully inserted into the oven slot I recommend carefully moving the door to the fully open position, being careful to avoid twisting the inserted spring's extension, so that the hinge lock can be re-positioned to the locked position, the door full removed, and start again to install it. It helps to have two persons to hold opposite sides of the door for this operation as the door is heavy, but not essential. When in the proper position the hinge extensions may not appear fully inserted, but this is normal to allow for closing of the built in locks. It helps to observe how much of the hinge extension is exposed either before removing the door initially, or, if you have a double oven, looking at the hinges on the door of the other oven. Good luck with your repair. Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Inner glass was broken by previous tenants",
        "repairInstruction": "Read all the way through this once before doing it. It really helps in keeping pieces and parts separated. First I had to take off the oven door. Please do this as it will make your life so much easier! The owners instructions does a lousy job explaining how to do this. You need to insert a small Allen wrench into the holes behind the do or hinge pin. Just stick them in there and leave them. If you don't have Allen wrenches you can use small nails or the like, but you have to put something into the holes. Close the door slowly, yes it will feel like you are going to break the hinges or the wrenches. When you get the door almost completely closed you should wiggle the door a bit by the handle and pull up. The door will come off. Once you get the door off you can get to work. Leave these wrenches in the hinge holes. You will need a flat surface big enough to lay the door down to work on it. Lay it down with the handle towards the surface and the broken glass facing you. Remove the 4 screws on the broken glass side, the 2 screws holding the brackets on the bottom and the 2 screws on the top of the door. You will need to wiggle the inside cover off because there are 2 little clips at the top you need to get it off of the outer glass door. You should have 2 separate pieces, the outer glass of the door and the inner tempered glass and sheet metal portion of the door. Set the outer glass door aside, somewhere safe, as you really don't want to have to reorder that part too! From there you can lay the door down with the broken inner door glass towards the work surface. Remove the screws and good pieces of glass and lay them down in the order you take them out. This helps putting them back together later. Keep the pieces together in sets so you know which set goes to each section. There should be 3 pieces of glass total in the assembly. You remove the screws and the 2 good pieces of glass. The inside door glass is accessible under a large piece of sheet metal held in place by little flanges cut into it. You can remove this sheet metal panel piece by wiggling it out away from under the hinges and away from the hinge end. There is a piece of insulation under there as well. Make sure you reseat it correctly when you put it all back together. If you don't it will stick out, and make things hard to line up. Pull the broken glass out, Put the new glass in and replace the sheet metal panel. At this point I would suggest putting the four screws you took out at the very beginning from the inside of the door back in. They keep the 2 hinge assemblies in place and they will be harder to line up if you don't. You need to work from the bottom side up but it's pretty easy to get the 4 screws back in. Don't be afraid to wiggle the pieces around so you can line up the holes. They need to line up so that the hinges line up back to the oven. Reverse how you took the other glass pieces out and put the door back together. Put the front glass piece back on and secure it in place with the bottom door brackets and screws and the top 2 screws. Lift the door unit back up by the handle and place it in the slots for the hinges exactly the way you removed it. You will feel it sort of catch when you pull the door open slowly. Remove the Allen wrenches and you are done. Read less"

Normally if it cracks during the clean cycle it is due to a defect or a unnoticeable chip or small crack that was in the glass and the heat can cause the larger crack or break.

Before making your purchase, bear in mind that this genuine OEM replacement part is sold separately from the rest of the door assembly. How Buying OEM Parts Can Save You Time and Money",

    "description": "When the igniter reaches a high enough temperature, these coils (Coil Valve, Dryer Gas Valve Coil Kit, Dryer Valve Coil Kit, Gas Valve Solenoid) work together to open the gas valve and allow the gas to enter the burner. This is a safety mechanism to ensure that there are no unsafe buildups of gas inside your appliance. The coils are attached to the dryer gas valve. If the dryer does not heat or heats intermittently, the coil may not be opening the gas valve. Both coils must be operational for the valve to open. No continuity would indicate a defective coil, but they can be intermittent and fail when they get hot. Both coils should be replaced when one of them is broken. This part can break as a result of material fatigue from normal use. This part measures approximately 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch in height, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/beige. This part features a 3-terminal boost/hold coil and a 2-terminal secondary coil",

I bought all possible parts $170 w. ship given the dryer age. Three day delivery Denver to Phila. Before attempting to repair, called Kenmore service and. Was told one month before tech was available, unacceptable. Went to several appliance stores to buy new and found earliest available delivery would be 1 - 3 months! So went online to attempt repair. Found Parts Select which had numerous examples of exact problem and identified likely defective parts. So we avoided spending $1600 on a new dryer. The three installed parts were about $60!

Thought it was the cycling thermostat, so replaced that, but did not solve the issue. Ordered the coils, and cleaned out heavily clogged lint from bottom of lint trap, especially right above the fan motor at the bottom of the trap. Received the coils, opened the top and front, took out drum, and replaced the coils. The replacement took less than 2 minutes. Be careful putting the drum back on to make sure the felt is not caught inside the drum. You can give it a spin to make sure. Wear gloves, as I cut myself up pretty good on the edges of the dryer body. The inside of my dryer looks like a crime scene! Anyway, I put it back together, and it runs great. Solved the timer advance issue in autodry, and the heat kicks on and off when it is supposed to. Good luck! Thanks Part Select! Read less"

        "expertAnswer": "Hi David,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a few parts that might cause this problem, however you should check your Radiant Flame Sensor to see if it is malfunctioning. This part senses heat from the igniter to monitor if it is hot enough to ignite gas to light the burner. Once the igniter is hot enough it will open the valve and allow gas to flow. This is a safety mechanism to prevent dangerous levels of gas from building up. \n\nI hope that helps!"

So, in result the drying time was very long, and clothes were cold and still not satisfactionally dry; occasionally only it was hot. It became obvious to me that gas burner only occasionally is working. On the Internet I found some instructables, mostly on YouTube, but also on this site (the Burner diagram): thus I have learned that the culprit must be the two tiny ignition coils: they worked only sometimes, so it was only a jeopardy when checking them using a continuation meter (voltmeter with continuation feature). For the access to the burner combo I used a small checking door right below the large door, in front wall of the dryer. There are only two small screws which hold a small piece of metal which cover these tiny coils. However, I had to disconnect the burner from gas pipe to get better access to those screws.

        "expertAnswer": "Hi Sam, Thank you for the question. I suggest trying to replace the 'M' Series Ignition Coil Kit,PartSelect Number PS470049. You can also test them with a Multi-Meter. The two prong coil will read 1,000-1,300 ohms, and the three prong coil will read 1,300-1,400 ohms across prongs 1&2, and 500-600 ohms across prongs 1&3. Hope this helps."

        "expertAnswer": "Hi John,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. In most cases this part is the problem and needs to be replaced. You could also check your radiant flame sensor with a multi-meter to see if that part is malfunctioning at all. That is the second most likely part to cause a problem like this. While you are testing parts I would also suggest testing your control thermistor as well. Good luck with your repair!"

I have a multi meter to check with.",

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Jim, thank you for your question. Even though the repair video is for a stand alone dryer, the installation on your unit would be the same. Once you gain access to the heater section, by removing the slanted panel under the dryer control panel, there will be a safety cover that can be removed. All the heater, coils, thermostats should be visible from there. You could then follow the following instructions for installing the coils:\n\nRemove 2 Phillips screws with short handled Phillips driver that hold the gas valve coil bracket in place. Unplug and remove both coils, installed new coils and bracket. Re installed safety panel, screws and slanted cover. \n\nI hope this helps!"

I suggest checking the Control Thermistor, PartSelect Number PS1149368.This part controls the temperature of the inside of the dryer drum. This part is located in the blower housing. This part can be tested with a multi-meter. It should ready 50K ohms of resistance at 77 degrees F. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!"

You will need to check the flame sensor, the control thermistor, the igniter, the limiter, the blower housing and wheel, and the thermostat.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "customerQuestion": "Our dryer will initially heat up for a few minutes, but then shuts off and does not come back on the rest of the drying time. Once its off for a bit and we restart the dryer, the heat will come on again, but only for a few minutes and then shuts off. I replaced the cycling thermostat but that didnt resolve that. The other 2 sensor that are in that path, i double checked the continuity and they read zero ohms. Is there any way for me to narrow down that its these 2 solenoids or is there possibly something else for me to look at? Thanks in advance.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Devin, thank you for your question. If the cycling thermostat has been replaced, and the other thermostats have been tested and are functioning properly, the issue is probably the Igniter Part Number: WE4X739, or the coils part number WE4X692 and WE4X693. It sounds like the coils are initially opening and allowing the unit to light, but then failing after the unit heats up. I would recommend replacing the coils first, and if that doesn't fix the issue, the igniter. I hope this helps!"

Went to Partselect site and it had a troubleshooting section and read and narrowed down the part needed by ohming the coils. Ordered the coils for less than $20 and ordered a natural gas to propane conversion kit. Par ts arrived in 2 days on regular shipping, very quick! Instruction were very simple to follow and coils were installed in under 15 mins. Propane conversion kit was perfect and was installed in 30 mins and dryer ran just like new. Cleaned inside thoroughly and couldn't be happier. Thank you partselect for great service and saving what would have been more than a $300 service call. Did myself for under $50. I highly recommend this site and will use when ever I can!!! Great service, great way to do business!!! Read less"

I found one at a local supplier a nd finished the switch. I chose to change the belt while in there because the dryer sounded like the belt had a chunk missing with the rhythmic thump. After installing the new, I found that one of the tumble paddles had a penny flopping inside it. One thump per revolution.

        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

You will need to replace this if the bushing has worn out, or if the ball support is damaged. This kit includes one bearing, one ball shaft, one ball bearing, one ball bearing retainer, a small tube of high temperature lubricant and installation screws. Unplug your dryer before you begin this repair. How Buying OEM Parts Can Save You Time and Money",

        "repairInstruction": "I basically followed the video instructions on your website. Pretty simple but ran into an issue pre-threading the 3 self taping screws into the spindle bearing. The screws provided were blunt on the end and did not tap easily at all. I used the existing screws that were much more \"sharp\" and worked much better. Also, the new screws were Philips drive and due to the amount of torque trying to self tap nearly stripped them out. The old sharper screws were square drive which had a better bite. So basically, I used the old screws to self tap and then used the new screws for the final installation. It took a long time to clean all the lint out from the inside of the dryer. The motor was completely embedded with lint and animal hair. You may want to suggest that a good cleaning may be needed so bring a shop vac...and also something to carefully pick the lint balls out from around the motor armature and bearing area.

        "expertAnswer": "Hello Katie, the most common reason for this happening is a restricted or overly long dryer ducting. If there is too much heat and not enough air flow it will cause a blow back into the cabinet, which would greatly affect your bearings. This is also harmful to other mechanical and electrical features in your dryer. We recommend inspecting your dryer ducting before replacing the drum bearings again. Best of luck with this repair!"

Then the front panel of the dryer can be removed. From here you can install the new felt seal 134440200 (which can be glued down). To get to the bearings you will need to remove the belt, then the tub can be lifted out of the front of the unit. From there you can change the bearings. Please let us know if you have any further questions."

        "storyTitle": "Dryer was making increasingly loud \"thumping\" sound.",
        "repairInstruction": "Parts were shipped quickly, packaged correctly, and were in original GM packages - very reassuring. BTW, your customer service is excellent.Reviewed YouTube videos.Patience is required, take your time, take photos of the wires and also make a written wiring chart. This was the flaw in my planning. Reference the schematics f rom PartsSelect to number the controls. Do NOT use masking tape to identify the wires as they will have all stuck together by the time you go to reinstall them. Most difficult process was removing and identifying the numerous wires to the back panel. They have push connectors, but some were very difficult to remove. The people doing the \"how to\" videos no doubt had them partially released and that made it look easy. Examine the connectors before removing to identify how they are captured by the connector. A paper clip \"tool\" I made enabled me to release some of the capture lugs, but some were so tight, I had to use small needle-nose pliers to open up the lug to release the wire on the connector. When reinstalling, re-tighten those connectors.Replacing the parts was much easier than the wiring disconnect/reconnect process. I'm happy to report that replacing the rear bearing and the front 2 green and 2 white shim/bearings immediately and completely solved my problem. For about $150, I restored my dryer to \"like-new\" functionality and got a lot of satisfaction from doing it. The project took about 4 hours, which could have been reduced to 2 hours had I know about the clip release and wiring identification process. Also, make sure you thoroughly vacuum out your unit while it is disassembled. Good luck!!! Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Excessive Drum Noise While Drying Clothes",
        "repairInstruction": "The PartSelect company's \"how to\" repair videos are OUTSTANDING. Thank you! The videos provided a comprehensive overview of what to expect in terms of clothes dryer disassembly, component replacement and reassembly. The videos were invaluable tutorials for prior-to-disassembly work.I ordered all the following parts which I fel t were likely excessively worn--white and green bearing slides (two of each required), rear drum bearing kit, drive belt, and idler pulley wheel--to address the noisiness issue.For your consideration: Since our dryer is 12 years old and would be disassembled anyway, I decided to order a new dryer drum belt and idler pulley, to replace these two constant-use items as preventive maintenance.Two notes.One: When replacing the dryer drum bearing parts, you need a T25 torx bit to loosen and remove the three torx-head screws. But using my T25 torx bit-head-style screwdriver, it was impossible to loosen them. Fortunately, I had a T25 torx bit, which I could mount in a socket wrench, which DID allow me to loosen those three torx-head screws without damage/breakage. WHEW! Recommend you are similarly prepared!Two: If you purchase the \"Rear Drum Bearing Kit,\" it already comes with the the \"Drum Bearing Sleeve\" and \"Retainer O-Ring\" components I thought I would also need--no need to purchase separately. I returned those two items, unopened, for a refund.All together, from dryer disassembly to, component replacement, to a thorough vacuuming/cleaning, to reassembly and an operational check, it took about four hours. The dryer is now nearly noiseless again! Success!I consider myself reasonably good with tools and have a fair amount of electrical and mechanical skill. My wife assisted with extra hands a couple times, too, seriously reducing my frustration level. Depending on your abilities, you'll take more time or less time than the four hours it took me. I'm certain I saved at least a couple hundred dollars by doing this maintenance myself.In summary, the PartSelect person taking my order was knowledgeable and professional, I received my parts two days after ordering, the parts worked perfectly, and the company refunded my two, unopened returned parts promptly. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend them to any capable do-it-yourselfer.Thanks, PartSelect! Read less"

        "storyTitle": "Squeaking",
        "repairInstruction": "Replace the front and rear bearings. When I have to do it again I will only order (3106), (313), 2x (316) green, 2x (316) white, and drive belt. Taking it apart and putting it back together was easy. Unplug the unit. Take out the 2 philips screws that hold on the top. Lift the top from the front to clear the locking tabs in the back and t ake it off. Take out the 2 5/16 screws that hold on the front. Tilt the front (door) forward and rest the drum on the dryer sides, you'll see it. Disconnect the wiring harness for the light and door switch, 2 wires. Lift the front off the bottom retaining clips and place aside. Have someone hold up the drum. Reach under and unhook the drive belt. Pull out the drum assembly. Take off the rear bearing, 3 screws. Clean out the heating element area in the back of the dryer while you have a chance. Replace the bearing assembly. I bought the entire bearing assembly but I could have gotten away with just the sleeve ( 3106), but I didn't know that at the time. Take off and replace the drive belt. Lock the tension arm for the drive belt into the compressed position shelf holder by the motor, push the arm down, you'll see it. Replace the drum and have someone hold it up while you rehook the drive belt and release the tension arm. Now, I would suggest replacing the entire front bearing. If the slides have been bad for a while, the plastic bearing (housing) is probably worn out and cracked. I had to order a front bearing assembly because the new slides wouldn't work with the worn out assembly, no big deal, it came quick. Unscrew the light bulb. Slowly pull the assembly away from the top of the front metal panel, slowly, and pay attention to where everything lines up. Replace the new front bearing and put the new slides on the little plastic tabs, be careful so you don't snap them off. Green on top, white on the sides. Replace the lightbulb. Set the front panel into place on the tabs at the bottom of the dryer. Rehook the door wires (2), and have someone hold up the drum while you slide the front bearing into the drum. Holding the front panel in place, turn the drum by hand and check for binding, things that don't sound or look right. Replace the 2 nuts to hold on the front. Plug it in, keep your hands back, turn it on, look, listen, everything fine. Open door, unplug, replace the top and the 2 screws that hold it on. Plug in, turn it on and check for any noise, you shouldn't hear any. If you do, you didn't do something right or maybe your drive pulleys are bad. A good dad and son job; especially getting on the ground and reaching under to deal with the drive belt. Watch out for sharp edges on the sheet metal and be slow and careful with the front plastic bearing so it doesn't snap. Your now good for 5 more years. A 2 on the difficulty scale, just take it slow and have an extra set of hands. Read less"

You will need to check the drum bearing slides, the front drum bearing, the duct felt seal, the rear drum bearing kit and the drive belt.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

I know for sure that i need the front bearing and slides that apparently attach to this bearing with adhesive or something.  However i do not know if i need additional parts.  When i start the dryer, the motor runs but the tumbler does not rotate unless i stop the motor and adjust the worn plastic front bearing (pulling it toward the front slightly)... after which it will turn.  i know my belt is ok, but wonder about the pulleys.  when the front panel is off the dryer should there be anything that holds the barrel up level?  do you think replacing the front bearing will do the trick?  i'm also a bit unsure as to the number of slides to get and whether or not i need to just purchase the slide or the slide kit.  i do not see where a slide kit (with the metal bracket) would go.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hi Brenda,\n\nThank you for your question. It sounds like you have figured out what parts are causing your issue. You can also check the rear drum bearing as well. The pulley would be easy to check. If you are able to spin your drum after adjusting your slides, then the pulley is fine. The belt runs over the pulley, so if it was not working you would not be able to spin your drum. Most dryers have anywhere between 2-4 slides. Good luck with your repair."

        "repairInstruction": "I have read other postings which describe most of the procedure very well, so I'm just going to add things that should be considered, which I have not read about here. Removing the drum proved difficult due to the lack of room on the two sides.The vent blower motor bracket is at the front bottom of the dryer, and when the two screws on either the left or right side are removed, the dryer sides spread more easily and allow the drum to be removed or re-installed more easily. Next, the rear drum bearing I bought has a rubber o-ring which holds it in place. There is a good chance this o-ring will be hard and brittle after years of service, and will crumble when removed, in order to replace the bearing. I had to run to the local hardware store to get a new o-ring, and could only find one that did was not rated for high heat usage. I presumed once the drum is re-installed that the bearing can't dislodge even with a missing o-ring. I think it just holds the bearing in place while removing and re-installing the drum, but I cannot be certain about this.So if you plan to replace the rear drum bearing, make sure to also order the o-ring that holds it in place. It is doubtful you can re-use the old one depending on the age of your dryer.Replacing the old white belt tensioning pulley requires the removal and re-installation of a \"nut\" that has no threads. It is forced on and off and not simple to re-install. The removal was easy simply by using a wrench to \"unscrew\" it counterclockwise. But re-installing it is another matter. It requires force to get it back onto the shaft. I saw a tip to use a 7/16\" socket placed over the nut and hit with a hammer while bracing the bracket from the other side. I did this by used a smaller tool, linesman's pliers, which provided the force needed. Install it about 1/4\" past the end of the bracket shaft. Careful, that nut has sharp edges and I ended up bleeding from that process. Three hands would help: one to brace the bracket, one to hold the nut and socket in place, and one to hammer. So good luck with that. Probably there is a smarter way to do this.If you replace the old white plastic belt tensioning pulley with a new yellow one, it is not simple to understand how to re-install the belt properly. The videos do not do the trick adequately. I did find one on youtube where they removed the dryer side in order to show the belt installation and I had an \"aha moment\". Since you cannot see the belt, the pulleys, the motor, or anything else during installation, it is not a simple thing to do. Here are my tips: Before re-installing the drum, move the belt tensioning pulley bracket to the right (when facing the dryer front) and you will see a little spot where the bracket will stay to the right when engaged in this spot. Engage the bracket and then proceed to re-install the drum. That way, when you reach under the drum to set the belt properly on the pulleys, you won't have to engage the tensioning bracket without being able to see. Once the belt is in place, carefully remove the bracket from the right holding spot and allow it to move back to the left operating position. I used two hands and don't think I could have done it with one. When the belts are new, they can be naturally twisted and you have to be careful to install the belt with no twist. I had to do it twice to get it right. If someone can take up the top belt slack for you, it's easy to feel the belt underneath the drum and get any twists out.Next, i had a hard time inserting the drum back into the dryer and finding the hole where the bearing inserts. The problem is, if you are not careful, it's easy to move, bend, or break the heater wires which surround the hole you need to locate blindly and slip the drum bearing into. I did bend those wires, but luckily not break them. In hindsight, applying some masking tape to the rear inside panel of the dryer right at the top, left and right of the drum BEFORE removing the drum would have made it much easier estimating the proper drum height while maneuvering the bearing into the rear hole. Then remove the masking tape when done. I ordered a new top plastic front bearing that supports the drum in the front. Good thing I did because mine was split about 5\" where one set of the green and white sliders install. I had one white \"plastic\" insert visible. The other one plus the two green bearings were totally missing. No wonder it was squealing.Finally, the hardest part for me was re-installing the top of the dryer! Take a good look before removing it so you can see exactly how the top fits to the dryer and how the parts need to be lined up first. Thanks to PartSelect.com! Every part was correct and the installation videos gave me so much help. Also, parts arrived in two days, which surprised me. I will be ordering all parts here. Read less"

        "customerQuestion": "My dryer develops a loud thumping noise as it heats up. After 10 minutes it is thumping at its loudest  im sure this is a heat related problem because it doesn't thump if i run it on fluff which uses no heat  this problem started after i replaced the top front bearing because the slides were worn off and the drum had started wearing into the bearing itself. I even put a new motor in it. The original problem was the dryer stop tumbling  during heat cycles after about ten minutes(about the same time the thumping is at its worst) but it wasnt thumping originally  i created that problem somehow after i replaced the bearing.  It will automatically start tumbling and drying again after it cools down after about 5 minutes. This process goes on and on until it finally has the clothes dry after about a hour or so. My question is. What could i have done replacing the bearing that would make it thump during heatup(by the way i replaced the long felt peice too that goes around the bottom piece of the bearing. And 2nd im guessing that one of the 3 thermostats is faulty and thats why its kicking off when hot(never kicks off during non-heat fluff cycles)  my understanding is that the thermisters only control turning the heat elements on and off.(is that correct?) so thermisters wont turn dryer off they will just cause heating problems when failing. I need advice on what parts i need advice on what i did to create this thumping noise.  Thank you very much.",
        "expertAnswer": "Hello Garry, thank you for your question. In regards to the bearing; It sounds like the thumping might be a result of the bearing at the back of the drum. I would check the rear bearing part number WE25M40 to see if the part is bad. In regards to the temperature problem; I would check the safety thermostat part number WE4M160 which is located on the heating element. This thermostat acts as a safety mechanism that keeps the dryer from overheating. Once the dryer temperature reaches a certain point, this piece will shut down power to the heating element. If the unit isn't cycling properly this might be the cause. While you in there testing that thermostat you might want to test the other ones that are located on the heating element as well. I hope this helps!"

        "storyTitle": "Idler pulley arm mounting screw stripped",
        "repairInstruction": "This should have been a simple repair, but turned out to be time consuming and moderately difficult. I hope these instructions will help anyone who encounters the problems described here. After a period of the dryer not being used, the idler pulley wheel froze on the shaft of the idler pulley arm, so I needed to replace both parts. After mounting the new wheel and two washers on the new arm and securing with a retaining ring, I went to install this assembly by going in through the small access panel at the rear of the dryer. I slid the belt off the old idler pulley wheel and unhooked the spring from the idler pulley arm; the arm was mounted on a sleeve fastened to the motor bracket by one screw. All that should have been necessary was to back out that screw and replace the old idler pulley assembly with the new one. That is where the trouble started. Backing out the screw with a socket driver, I found it would go a few turns, then start to bind. I tried turning it in and out to get the threads to engage, but it kept binding. Eventually I gave the screw a hard turn, and then it would turn freely but not move in or out. Looking on the internet for advice, I found a video that asserts for another model Maytag dryer using the same type of mounting for the idler arm, that there is a design flaw. You can find the video by searching for âMaytag dryer idler pulley defectâ. According to the video, the sheet metal screw used to mount the idler pulley arm can gradually loosen due to the pressure and vibration, and begins to âwaggleâ which eventually damages the threads. I believe this is what happened to my dryer. The video suggests replacing the sheet metal screw with a machine screw and nut for a more durable union. So now I understood how the screw could be stripped just sitting in the dryer, but that didnât help me get the screw out. Working through the rear access panel, I tried pulling on the screw head with several types of pliers, pushing the point from behind with a piece of wood while turning the head with a socket driver; eventually I was able to use a pry bar under the screw head and sleeve to apply pressure while turning the head, and with that method the screw backed out. With the screw removed, it could be seen that the threads in the middle part of the thread length were almost completely worn away. The screw sleeve got somewhat deformed in this process so I ordered a new one, along with an exact replacement sheet metal screw, hoping the threads in the hole were still intact. With the old idler pulley arm now removed, I could transfer the old idler bracket spacer to the new idler pulley arm. When the ordered parts arrived and I tried to mount the idler pulley arm, the new screw would go in only a couple of turns before binding. Rather than risk winding up in the same situation by forcing the screw, I decided to use a machine screw and nut instead. The original sheet metal screw was a #10. A machine screw the same size would not fit through the hole, and I could not fit my drill into the dryer cabinet in a position to enlarge the hole, so I used a #8 machine screw with a nut and lock washer. First I put some grease on the contact areas of the screw sleeve and idler bracket spacer, then inserted the machine screw through the hole and put the lock washer and nut on the other side of the mounting. The space around the nut is very limited, and most of my tools were too large to hold the nut while the screw was tightened. It was too small for a socket or adjustable wrench, and the clearance from the exhaust duct was too small for the handles of most tools. Eventually, I found a needle nose pliers with short handles that did the job. A thin open end wrench might also work. Then I reconnected the spring and belt to the idler pulley assembly, and closed the access panel. So far the dryer works, but if the #8 screw turns out to be not strong enough, I could get an extension for my drill and enlarge the hole to fit a #10 machine screw and nut. Looking back on the job, the most difficult part of this repair was removing the damaged screw. This and several other steps might have been a lot easier if I had removed the motor bracket (where the idler pulley arm is mounted) from the dryer and worked outside the cabinet. Part Select has an excellent video âReplacing the Drive Motorâ that shows how to do this. It would be a lot of disassembly work, but for someone with good assembly skills could be easier in the long run. Hopefully most folks out there who replace the idler pulley arm on a dryer will find an easier situation than I did. But for any who have to deal with a stripped mounting screw, I hope this summary will help you resolve it. Read less"

The picture you show of the replacement knob doesn't appear to include the outer plastic ring (the part that has the arrow that shows what setting it's pointed to).  I was able to snap that ring off the old knob.  Do i just use the old outer ring or do i need to buy that as well?  I see you have 2 different part numbers showing for my dryer.  I don't understand what the difference is between them:   We01x20378 (control knob and clip) and we01x20374 (timer knob).  What's the difference between the two parts?  Thanks!",

Then, simply remove the old pad and replace it with the new one. Finally, re-attach the leg by turning clockwise. Ensure that the washer is level, and adjust the leg accordingly if it is not.",

If you notice the appliance is uneven to the floor or wobbling, it may indicate that the levelling foot needs to be replaced. You will need pliers and a block of wood to perform this task. There will be one adjustable foot found in the package. Lift the dryer and place the wood to keep it propped up. You may need to use the pliers to remove the old foot. Screw the new foot into place using your hand. Once the new leveling foot is in place, lift the appliance and remove the block. Test the machine out to ensure it is now sitting level.",

A damaged housing reduces drying efficiency, resulting in longer drying times, increased energy consumption, and higher utility costs. To replace it, consult the included instruction sheet. Open the dryer door, pull out the lint filter, and remove the screws below the door opening. Close the door and take off the front panel, placing it face down on a padded surface. Remove the blower seal from the front panel. Carefully pry outward on the top corners of the collector duct to disconnect it from the front panel. Once the top is clear, pull out and lift to release the lower locking tab from the front panel slot. This will free the assembly. Note that this replacement part does not include the duct seal, the blower seal, or the lint screen itself, so consider this before purchasing.",
